    "The project aims to analyze how the public, as represented by Reddit comments, perceive the performance of Trump's presidency in various political areas such as the economy, foreign affairs, COVID, gender, etc. The goal is to propose a logistic model that measures the relationship between a given political topic (for instance, gender) and the overall sentiment of the public on that specific topic: the idea is to measure Trump's perceived presidency performance on different political areas (topics). The model would use the topics as a covariates and the overall sentiment as the dependent variable.\n"
