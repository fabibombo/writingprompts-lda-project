2- He convinced the Mexican government to modernise its labour laws as part of a trade treaty. Mexicans can now unionise properly! Could be argued that this doesn't affect the US, but I think that a happier and more well-protected workforce in a trade partner country will have benefits.

3- He started positive reforms to the prison system with the First Step act.

4- he killed (not personally) Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Trump signed the biggest wilderness protection & conservation bill in a decade and designated 375,000 acres as protected land.

I frankly usually say this as a joke, but you know, there really is some serious truth to it.

We need new thoughts in America. We need new perspectives and we need young people to get involved. That doesn't happen if they don't believe they can make a difference, and being president certainly allows them to make a big difference.

Now, after Trump, when they look around and see someone who doesn't fit the traditional political mold, who (IMO at least) isn't qualified for the job, it lowers the bar. That's a bad thing generally, but maybe in this case it makes some kid say ""hey, maybe I DO have a chance, I don't necessarily need to be a Harvard grad or a war hero or something really tough like that to be president"", and maybe that kid turns out to be a fantastic president.

Giving up before a fight even begins because you think you have no chance is a horrible thing. Trump shows people that truly ANYONE could be president, so they'll be more willing to start that journey. And, even if they ultimately fail, they may do some good in the process anyway.

These are A few of my favorites and why I am pleasantly surprised with his presidency.  The truth is that there is a long list of his accomplishments that would surprise almost anyone but the major media networks still want you to believe that he is a ‘foreign asset’ despite America first being his number one platform as a politician. 

Either trump is as terrible as so many people claim, (hitler with bad hair) or he’s made a lot of formerly powerful people very angry and we are finally seeing how dirty politics can get in a real fight rather than having two parties who serve the same puppet masters.

I think for his own mouth but the media as well. I am going to label one point here, that's going to be long but I want it to be because it is the exact reason for why you think Trump hasn't done anything. Media narrative and confirmation bias. 

I will use the example of the crack down on illegals. Obama was the absolute [""Deporter in Chief""](https://www.axios.com/immigration-ice-deportation-trump-obama-a72a0a44-540d-46bc-a671-cd65cf72f4b1.html), he just didn't want people to know about it. The media was fine with that too so they didn't really make issue with it. Trump is a racist for deporting less people though. 

I was so against his ""Build the Wall"" bullshit from the get-go. Mainly bc the worst of the US loved it and the media focused on them, making it seem worse, but also I think that as a business owner, if I can hire someone who will work harder for $10 over someone else who works at half the speed for $11, I felt I should be able to. I also don't blame illegals for coming here, in the least. But after realizing that it wasn't about racism as the media and his critics want you to think. It was about poor Americans getting a job. Black unemployment rate was the lowest it had [been in decades, maybe history](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000031) once Trump got his policies going.

If we were going to get the poor in this country back in the workforce, we had to make jobs for them. Since poor people usually start at jobs near the bottom, same as illegals, we had to clear out the people taking those jobs and thats exactly what happened.

The difference in the admins strategies is that Trump made it harder for people to get/stay on welfare bc he knew that there were jobs opening. While this may seem cruel and whatnot, people need a kick in the ass sometimes. Obama gutted the restrictions for welfare, allowing more of the poor to sit back and collect a check.  Trump didn't and the unemployment #s showed that across the board. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is think about what is going on and stop reading the news, especially headlines from Reddit. Because just like the ""Sturgis Was a Super Spreader"" headline, it's created with a narrative to make you feel a certain way.

2. Lowest black unemployment rates during the same time-frame

He does have some achievements worth noting.

Trump helped broker fully normalized relations between the UAE and Israel.  This is a big deal for the  middle east.


BBC.com/news/world-us-canada-54092960


It's a big enough deal that a Norwegian politician nominated Trump for a Nobel peace prize for his role in the normalized relations and stated that he should be judged on the facts of the action and not ""on the way he behaves sometimes.""  He likely won't win one, but I'd love to see leftist heads explode if he did.   I don't think I could handle the righteous right gloating though... 


Reducing our dependence on China with matching tarrifs during a time the Chinese government is increasingly expansionist and flouting of human rights is something I agree with.  He may say stupid shit like calling Xi Xinping a great leader, but he's maintained the military pivot to Asia and offering assurance to our allied Asian nations.  His actions aren't in line with his verbal praise of Chinese leadership.


Many of his ""accomplishments"" will also be good or bad depending on your political views and what you think is right.  For instance, many of his religious freedom policies have been steps backward for US domestic social issues (he's anti-abortion).  I think because ""religion"" in the US is currently synonymous with Christian.  This needs to change and Trump has NOT helped this on the domestic side.


But, on the international stage he has publicly called out Nigeria for the killing of Christians during a conference call with Nigeria's President and has also criticized China for their persecution Uighur Muslims.  He's been consistently strong about backing religious freedoms on the international front.

Didn't every recent president since Clinton or earlier promise to move to US Embassy to Jerusalem, but then backed out fearful of Palestinian backlash? Trump did it without blinking an eye.


For me, it was enough that Trump walked over the border into North Korea, fearless and unprotected - to the utter shock of the world who watched. And for a brief time there was hope for North South Korea unification and across Asia their was a pro-Trump love-fest that America was largely shielded from. In the USA, the MSN which had been running with Nuclear War narrative quickly shut the hell up and changed the subject.

He more of less destroyed ISIS by giving General Mattis a free hand (do you remember how bad the ISIS threat was prior to 2016? That's gone now!), 

He ordered the killing of Soleimani, and the entire middle east is better off for it. 

Even students in Iran started *walking around* ground-paintings of the American Flag - out of *respect* for America!

He changed the overton window on China, standing up to theft of American IP when everyone else was too gutless - this is just icing on the cake!


This list won't be believed because it's Trump's recent press release from the white house. If even 2% is true, I am sufficiently impressed.

He's been pushing back (well, our national security advisors) against foreign surveillance. It really is a huge benefit to US security. People don't understand why he's done things like attack TikTok, but they don't realize that TikTok has been involved with foreign intelligence to gather information on US citizens. This has been the case with other companies, and this administration is pushing back on every one they find.  


He's been doing more than former GOP presidents in the regard for attempting to lower healthcare prices. Hell, I'm extremely left on the healthcare issue, but the fact that a GOP member is trying to take steps in that direction is definitely worth mentioning. (just give us nationalized healthcare already, shit.)  


He's playing ball with Hong Kong. Removing the special status of Hong Kong has slighted China. I really appreciate the indirect support for Hong Kong, even if it was done only to piss of China. It's not necessarily great for Hong Kong, but in the long run, I believe it's being played out as a bargaining chip to help strengthen the democracy in Hong Kong.  


People on the left really don't look into Trump's administration, but I'm going to give you an example of confirmation bias really clouding reality, which is unfortunate. Trump actually signed an executive order pressuring the police forces in the US to stop using excessive force. Yes, the EO was very bureaucratic, but hopefully it has some effect. It would be hard to tell, anyway, because the media is not going to credit Trump with anything in this fight for police reform, and even right wing media won't talk about it either because it fucks up their own narrative and base. [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/19/2020-13449/safe-policing-for-safe-communities](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/19/2020-13449/safe-policing-for-safe-communities)  


This thing I'm going to mention is obviously going to be shrugged off, but try to give it some thought. The EPA and some other agencies were used as political action fronts for certain groups. Some of their powers were allowing them to rig certain things, like energy prices, energy production, etc. The conspiracy is that some of these were embedded with a function that allowed taxes to flow into other action fronts, by essentially taxing energy companies because they couldn't achieve impossibilities. When Trump was ""dismantling"" the EPA, what he was actually doing was cutting off these revenue streams and function of these fronts that really didn't do anything in terms of protecting the environment. The result is that it pissed off the team that put those in place, and made energy cheaper. It really had no effect on the environment either way, but it really stifled the Democrat power over energy. That's 100% why they threw a giant hoopla, ""they're going to get rid of the EPA!"" Which the GOP didn't. They just wanted to stop the DNC from using the regulatory ability of the EPA for their own political and globalist ideals.  


Trump has funded black colleges and universities more than any other president.  


I could keep going. I understand the guy is a terrible personality, and really makes our country look bad, but he's completely listening to advisors. That's the one thing I respect about Trump. He knows he's not the smartest guy (he's pretty dumb), and he knows he needs to hire the smartest people. Yes, they are conservative, but they are effectively running the country. No, I don't want Trump in office, but at least he hasn't been a lame duck, has been bolstering the shit out of US defenses, and is really being an A class conservative. There has been worse.   


If people start attacking me, saying that he's not running the country, our country is turning to shit.. Well. It's been turning to shit, regardless of the president.

There's a very long list of accomplishment trump has achieved, but I hope that I can offer a different approach that will eliminate the need for a reddit thread. Most of what I've seen here trump himself has spoken about at his state of the union speeches, press briefings, and his RNC acceptance speech. 

Sadly, due to social alienation and political division; almost all people who hate Trump will go as far as not trusting governmental research or advise (I.E. CDC, FDA, and certainly not White House press briefings.), and will simply dismiss it as lies because it's ""part of his administration."" This is why we're even doing this whole thread right now, there's too many people on the left side of the divide unwilling to even consider what the right says as anything more than lies, deceit, and evil. This is understandable, when the mostly left leaning mass media constantly drones on about what the right supposedly wants to do, proclaims it evil, racist, bigoted, sexist, and paints all of what a large number of people believe as fascist. 


It's important to hear the other side, not envelope ourselves in a bubble of our own egos. I was a liberal up until a month before the 2016 election. Too much has changed about the left since I was a child. It made sense when the right was a party of the types of people I am only now becoming more comfortable with; gun enthusiasts, military veterans, mechanics and tradesmen, devoted christians, and the general hard working union stiff. They used to intimidate me, confuse me, and upset me; but not because they wanted to. 


They did so because I didn't understand what they truly believed or why they did. Most of these people just want to make a good enough living to support themselves and their families, be able to protect themselves from threats to their families and communities, maintain safe communities through rule of law, but not have so many onerous regulations that it hurts the fruits of their labor. They don't have some grand vision of what's best for everyone else, and the one thing I've learned I resent most now as a minarchist libertarian is that someone else with no accountability thinks they can know best for millions of others, (basically bureaucrats) simply because they are ""intelligent."" Yes we need leaders, but I resent the ""intellectual"" as it's a dangerous path to lead letting a small group of people who will ultimately have their own biases and blindspots dictate policy without regard for others. This is why representative democracy is important; since the smaller districts require a more focused set of ideas that exist from those communities. 


Let me make my point (again) before I continue to ramble;


People who supported Trump are not ""evil."" The Trump administration is not 1 dimensional, nor is his support base. Conservatives are not out to get you. Talk to more of them (not just op, but all of you), and understand that they are people like you. They hold genuine beliefs about their lives and the lives around them, just like you do. If you don't feel you hold any ideals firm, then talk to someone about theirs so you can help solidify your own ego through attrition. Research. Don't trust mass media so readily, since most of their reporting is going to lean towards ""outrage."" They need to make their buck too. Empathize, stop sympathizing.

1. The USA - China trade war. This has been devastating for China. It's impossible to know just how damaged the Chinese economy is, but good sources are saying it is crippled and the Chinese regime is desperate. 

2. On the flip side, the US economy was booming, right up until Covid-19 hit. The economy was going from strength to strength. From the S&P500 to small local businesses pretty much everyone in America was on a high. 

3. He killed public enemy number 1. 

4. The Iranian economy has been fucked. A weak Iran gives America amazing leverage in the middle east. Enough perhaps to withdraw troops. Which brings us to. 

5. Withdrawing troops from Syria and Iraq. Continuing the Obama era plan to had over policing of the Middle East to Saudi Arabia and Isreal. Beinging American troops home. 

6. Continued the downwards trend of violent crime, right up until the BLM protests. 

7. Revealed the extent of the failure of the MSM at providing unbiased fair journalism. 

8. By doing nothing he's accidently made America the best country in the world to live through Covid.

As an African American he has brought to light what a great majority of us have always known. That there is a whole lot of racism. This is the bedrock of this nation and a great many of its white citizens. It has brought us out of our delusion and back to reality that this is a constant fight on a lot of fronts.

I think as a group we now know we must be pro-active at every level of government to root this kind of evil out. Not just vote every 4 years for a president. But every election at state and local levels.

Second, I think just as an American the rot of the system has donkey kicked the people in the face as to how bad politicians are at doing their job. We have to be active participants in getting the real things the people need not just the priveleged few. Which means we need to look at policies not people.

The American people have in effect become sloths that were oblivious to the ills of our society nc we were busy being distracted and now Trump has brought many of us back to focus on things we need to do to right this country.

Trump may have accidentally become the thing we needed in my opinion. I've had this opinion before he got elected. Knowing that this was a corrupt system. The lame two party system that spouts rhetoric with no meaning. The out of control corporations that poison us with no regard except more profits. The justice system that habitually punishes the poor whether they black, latino, or whites. Health system that just sucks. A religious fascism that has always been around. A racist far right or just right that finally did away with coded rhetoric. A neo-liberal left that's just Republican light. With both parties serving corporations not citizens. 

He was never the real problem but he surely put everything on Front Street for all to see. Now it's who's on what side and what actions that we take. There is a whole lot of old systems that need to be broken down. 

So to me Trump has done good accidentally. His awoken the people to action.

Well, I don't recall seeing a single trending popular post for the [Save Our Seas Act](https://apnews.com/2d5947a8bd924adc9f0ab077177fabdd). Amd you probably haven't even heard of the [Great American Outdoors Act](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/management/2020/08/what-the-great-american-outdoors-act-can-do/) because Reddit lied to you and tried calling it the ""Trump wants to release methane in to the world"" or whatever. The left wing media also blasted Trump for wanting to [trim forests to prevent wildfires](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/eo-promoting-active-management-americas-forests-rangelands-federal-lands-improve-conditions-reduce-wildfire-risk/) but conveniently forgot his administration pushed a huge [wilderness protection bill](https://www.newsweek.com/wilderness-protection-bill-donald-trump-sign-environment-largest-death-valley-1361412). Trump's Affordable Clean Energy bill also got a lot of flak for not being as restrictive as Obama's, but that's because the New York Times conveniently forgot they ran an article about how [Supreme Court blocked Obama's legislation from doing anything in the first place](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/us/politics/supreme-court-blocks-obama-epa-coal-emissions-regulations.html).

But if you were alive in 2014, you'd know [people sued them over bird deaths](https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2014/05/14/wind-energy-projects-must-nagivate-rules-protect-birds/9070505/) and [Trump nixed that](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/27/573845851/accidentally-killing-birds-isnt-a-crime-says-trump-administration). And while Trump has cut a bunch of repopulated animals from the endangered list, a [species of bees was added](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/insects/rpbb/FAQsFinalListing.html). It's not just some kind of groundwork for the first series of bee protection, it skips a lot of red tape and forces people to take care of bees if the species is in the area now instead of later.

I think it's more fair to look at what campaign promises has Trump kept. Specifically because those are things he said he was going to do.

Here's the list:

Trump signs resolution to reverse Obama's executive order on gun control.

President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum officially directing the United States to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, making good on a signature if not symbolic campaign promise.

President Donald Trump made his way to the White House promising his administration would be one to enforce laws -- and also one to get rid of excessive legislation.

Trump nominates Neil Gorsuch to fill empty Supreme Court seat left by Scalia.

Trump says U.S. pulling out of Paris climate agreement.

Create a 10-percent repatriation tax. The new repatriation tax rate isn't 10 percent, but it's close. Under the bill that passed, U.S. businesses that are holding assets overseas would be allowed to repatriate those assets at 8 percent, or 15.5 percent for liquid assets.

Keep Guantanamo Bay Detention Center open.

Suspend immigration from terror-prone places.

Move U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

Limit legal immigration.

 Typical Republican politicians don't do this because conservatives are generally uncomfortable with appeals that aren't universalist, they know that anything they do that touches race at all other than capitulate is going to get them called racist, and they likely buy into the same ""common knowledge"" among political elites that black people are destined to vote as a bloc. More diversity in the Republican party can bring more accountability to both parties by lessening the extent that the charge of racism can be used as a wedge issue. Making the funding restoration for historically black colleges permanent was a particularly helpful feature because it doesn't just help them, it takes that issue off the board so it can't be used as a wedge issue in the future and people can make their decision based on something other than perceived patronage.

Both sides think they are positive and the other negative.  No one steps in to the ring thinking they are the loser.  That being said...


He has managed to unify not only the folks that support or will vote for him, but those that don't.  To be able to organize not only your side but your opponents side single handily, is an impressive feat in my opinion.  More people will turn out to vote this year then ever before.  More people are getting involved, and taking action, organizing and speaking up because of him and even his opponents have no one else to thank but him, because their differences are being cast aside for a common enemy.  Love em, hate em, it's all the same.  More people will vote in the next 8 weeks then have ever voted before. That alone is amazing.

He pushes people.  He triggers them.  He makes them show their hand, and undoes a lot of facade.  Our elected officials can no longer hide behind the scenes and their filters.  He exposes their priorities and makes them wear their shame.  It doesn't matter if he gets reelected or not.  His presence has ushered in a well deserved and much needed change.  Politics will never be the same, and the old ways are fading.  Newer era progressives and capitalists are making leaps into the fray and igniting fires the likes congress has never seen.  Hes made not only us face ourselves in the mirror and make changes, he's challenged deep seated corrupted politicians and proved to them that they are not untouchable.  The miserable old misers are being left behind by younger more involved and innovative thinkers.

People are relying less and less on what the news tells us.  We are seeking the truth in everything we see or hear, and not relying on doctored documents and articles to tell us how to think or feel.  We are studying and researching and sorting facts from fiction, and we are no longer satisfied with just accepting what we are told.  Again...Donald Trump.

As far as the global community, and their opinions of him,  before they call this pot black, they need to look in the mirror and remember how kettle they are.  America barely qualifies as a gen z next to countries like Russia or China.  Their deep seated hatred and disgust comes from their own denials of their own history.  And not only has Donald Trump got americans for and against him rallying, hes got people all over the world pushing towards a new way forward.  This is something no single person in the known areas of history has accomplished.  New blood is popping up all over.  People we have never even heard of are making moves to make a difference.  Thier views under a level of magnification like no other because of him.  The whole world is watching him, and watching each other closer then ever before.  No more turning a blind eye.  

love em, hate em, it doesn't matter...tonight just his name mentioned got you talking, and asking questions, and thinking deeply about the things that really matter, and what we can do to fix the things that are so wrong.  Yes he's done some specifically impressive things.  Yes he has done the equal and opposite of those things as well.  Get out and vote, have the talks and discussions.  Say how you really feel, and be free doing it.  Just because you don't like what you see or hear doesnt make it wrong.  Understanding and compassion are shared on both sides of a battlefield, and in the end, remember we are all someones children.",0,2,0,2020-09-11 01:33:54,2,positive take negative take depend side spectrum fall side positive negative step ring thinking loser said managed unify folk support vote able organize side opponent side single handily impressive feat opinion turn vote ever getting taking action organizing speaking even opponent else thank difference cast aside common enemy love em hate em vote next week ever voted alone amazing push trigger make show hand undoes lot facade elected official longer hide behind scene filter expose priority make wear shame matter get reelected presence ushered well deserved needed change politics never old way fading newer era progressive capitalist making leap fray igniting fire like congress never seen he made u face mirror change challenged deep seated corrupted politician proved untouchable miserable old miser left behind younger innovative thinker relying le le news tell u seeking truth everything see hear relying doctored document article tell u feel studying researching sorting fact fiction longer satisfied accepting told donald far global community opinion call pot black need look mirror remember kettle america barely qualifies gen z next country russia china deep seated hatred disgust come denial history donald got american rallying he got world pushing towards new way forward something single person known area history accomplished new blood popping never even heard making move difference thier view level magnification whole world watching watching closer ever turning blind eye love em hate em matter tonight name mentioned got talking asking question thinking deeply thing matter fix thing wrong yes done specifically impressive thing yes done equal opposite thing well vote talk discussion feel free see hear doesnt wrong understanding compassion shared side battlefield end remember someone child ,0.01817219817219817,0.4956349206349206

A lot of people in this thread are talking about stuff Trump did as positive accomplishments.  The guys tasked with laying minefields around Cambodia, they probably ended each day feeling like they made a positive accomplishment.  I don't think they were all thinking ""I'm very proud of this thing which will randomly maim people and ruin lives for the next century"".  Most of what Trump has done is lay minefields for future politicians.  From the start, the people who are backing and advising Trump are small-government Tea Partyists and fundamental christians who want state-run psuedo-theocracies and no federal government.

 I think the only positive we'll see out of this will be the historical reaction to this catastrophic presidency.  Every single thing he has done has caught the attention of people who know there's a better way.  In the same way that WWII led to the cold war, which led to the space race, which created a generation of nerds, which led to the computer revolution, which allowed us to map the genome and cure diseases...in a long enough timeline, Hitler's monstrosities becomes crucial to saving millions of lives.  Perhaps he will be seen as the last dying gasp of a shitty status quo making room for a new world.Maybe after this we'll shift our culture away from limitless capitalization and industrialization and fix the planet.  Maybe we'll see a cultural revolution where the proletariat overthrow the ruling class, or in some other way fix the wealth disparity in the world.  Maybe we'll all realize Twitter and social media does for communication what McDonalds does for health. But it's too early to know.

It's literally easier for me to point to things Hitler did historically right, because Hitler was both evil and competent.  Trump is evil and *incompetent* and he's therefore being manipulated and enabled by the GOP.   It's hard to point to anything as an ""accomplishment"" when it seems that most of his personally-generated executive orders are just undoings of Obama's. By personal admission his entire cabinet was chosen because they have a desire to collapse the government.  Hell, the FEC can't even oversee this election because he hasn't appointed enough members for  them to have a quorum.  Most of what he does is act as a figurehead, lightning rod, distraction, and overall agent of chaos.  I will say that raising the China issue with the american public is probably deserved.  Their central government is worse than ours, and ours is intolerable.

Pretty much everything else he did personally his entire life was terrible, flawed, tainted, or bad for reasons the right is refusing to acknowledge.   Even his interpersonal familial love feels tainted and discolored. I would say that his fundamental MO is to mortage the long-term health of the country in trade for short-term profitability for the ruling class.  People in this thread are giving him credit for signing bills that he 1) didnt' create, 2) didn't endorse, and 3) didn't understand, because they too don't read the bills. 

For example, lots of people point to his work with N. Korea. Visiting Kim Jong Un ONLY benefits Trump and Kim Jong Un; he thinks its a feather in his cap towards peace and doesn't realize that being recognized by a world leader only gives legitimacy and job security to a third world dictator.  They only exist because China supports them, and they ransom nuclear attack for food.  Sure, we now produce more oil than Canada, but we did so by removing environmental regulations designed to prevent us from drowning in our waste products.  But he signed a $10,000,000 ""Save our Seas"" act, so when Exxon causes a trillion-dollar oil spill due to lax regulations, we'll have an underfunded agency which will clean up the Dawn Soap bottles floating next to the dead pelicans.

This is also why Indian people love Trump. Most presidents have to use detente when talking about Pakistan because we need their airspace to have access to Afghanistan.

https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/09/07/superfund-activists-donald-trump-minden-wv-400921

Titled *The One Incredibly Green Thing Donald Trump Has Done.* Trump’s EPA has remediate more Superfund sites in a year than any other administration has since 2001. It’s still a bit
of a mixed bag, where white neighborhoods were disproportionately prioritized, and they’ve completely ignored orphan sites, but a cleanup of a toxic waste dump is undoubtedly a good thing, and he’s done more than any president since Clinton with the program. Trump’s EPA has also been ruthless in refusing to settle for less penalties with the responsible parties, in a way no other administration has ever been, and that is a spectacular thing. Taxpayers should not be bailing out criminal corporations and government agencies. They should either pay up or be liquidated. 

I grew up within five miles of three of these noxious sites. I have zero sympathy for these heinous criminals, whether it’s a chemical company or the Navy.  These sites are responsible for thousands of slow, painful poisoning  deaths each. They’re corporate serial killers, and they should be thanking us profusely for not throwing everyone involved into a fucking gulag where they belong, instead of just fining them some worthless paper for a complete cleanup.  If it were up to me, I’d make the CEOs and generals clean up the waste with their bare hands like in the Handmaid’s Tale.

I won’t credit him with the Great American Outdoors Act or any other legislation of that nature — it is not some grand accomplishment to not veto a bill with overwhelming support. I also won’t credit him with any promotion of peace — his Iran policy has been a fucking trainwreck of dangerous brinksmanship, and it’s only luck and the Iranian government‘s wisdom that has prevented it from escalating to WW3.",0,1,0,2020-09-11 00:38:21,1,absolutely loathe spirit post something read earlier week found interesting http politico news magazine superfund activist donald minden wv titled incredibly green donald done EPA remediate superfund site administration since still bit mixed bag white neighborhood disproportionately prioritized completely ignored orphan site cleanup toxic waste dump undoubtedly done president since clinton program EPA ruthless refusing settle le penalty responsible party way administration ever spectacular taxpayer bailing criminal corporation government agency either pay liquidated grew within five mile three noxious site zero sympathy heinous criminal whether chemical company navy site responsible thousand slow painful poisoning death corporate serial killer thanking u profusely throwing everyone fucking gulag belong instead fining worthless paper complete cleanup CEOs general clean waste bare hand handmaid tale credit great american outdoors legislation nature grand accomplishment veto bill overwhelming support credit promotion peace iran policy fucking trainwreck dangerous brinksmanship luck iranian government wisdom prevented escalating WW3 ,-0.061111111111111116,0.5366666666666667

Moved the embassy to Jerusalem.

Deductions for average Americans on taxes.

Enough is enough. Stop preaching hate and stop trying to sow divisions where none should exist. We are all capable of feeling, bleeding, dying. Death does not discriminate, nor should life.

Still have a lot to read and respond to!",0,36290,2,0,AlexiosI,"I make a point of thinking about this regularly because I don't want to get caught up in the hyper-partisanship that, in my view, is destroying American society.  It's very difficult to give the President any credit though because, at this point, he is the leading cause of the hyper-partisanship.  Not just a symptom.  The symptoms were like the fireworks going off on the pier of the port of Beirut.  Trump is the Ammonium Nitrate tonnage they lit up.  But give him credit I will for the following:

1.  America was flying blind in the ChiMerica partnership with China.  Anyone who has watched a Chinese action movie like ""Once Upon a Time in China"" with Jet Li should know what China actually thinks of the West.  It is not positive.  It is grievance, scorn and contempt for the ""100 Years of Humiliation"" in their history where foreign powers, including the US, used their military and diplomatic influence to carve off pieces of China for their own economic goals.  An enormous cause of national shame in Chinese history.  The Chinese Communist Party may have opened up to free market reforms, but is has no intention of becoming a Western style Democracy.  Human rights are more or less considered a pain in the ass to the CCP, when they're considered at all.  Intellectual property theft isn't just a problem in Chinese companies, it's their lifeblood.  It is how business is done.  None of this was going to end well.  But American administration after administration kept ignoring the issues while our manufacturing base dried up and the Rust Belt rotted.  Trump was enough of an asshole to finally put a stop to this.  This was an enormous policy change and he deserves a great deal of credit for doing so.  
2. Killing Qasem Soleimani was a low cost, high impact foreign policy and national security move that probably averted a war in one fell stroke.  After attacking our troops in Iraq, the Iranian regime went all in on hubris and told the US ""There is nothing you can do"" about it.  Turns out pride comes before the fall.  We paid little to no price for the killing and showed the Iranians and others in the region we were still a force to be reckoned with, despite drawing down our military presence.
3. Trump is Anti-War.  It may seem counterintuitive but he genuinely seems to have a major aversion to starting military actions.  Just the other day he said the most honest thing about the American military industrial complex I've ever heard in my lifetime, calling out the Pentagon for endless wars to make money for military contractors.  

There are a few more positives, but I think those are the major ones.  My biggest problem with President Trump, even bigger than his personality and massive insecurities, is that he doesn't like to do the policy work that's necessary to run a country.  Any country.  But especially a huge country like the United States.  Everything this man does is quick solutions, photo ops, lip service and praise seeking.  When he gets bogged down in the details he can't hack it.  That is a huge problem for America and it has played itself out on a grand scale during Covid-19 where he has yet to formulate a national plan.  I just don't think he's capable of thinking in a Macro sense like that.  His M.O. seems to be focused on instant gratification within the news cycle instead of long term goals.  That simply does not work for running any sort of large organization.",0,1,0,2020-09-10 23:55:27,1,point thinking regularly want caught hyper partisanship view destroying american society difficult president credit though point leading cause hyper partisanship symptom symptom firework going pier port beirut ammonium nitrate tonnage lit credit following america flying blind ChiMerica partnership china anyone watched chinese action movie upon time china jet li know china actually think west positive grievance scorn contempt year humiliation history foreign power including US used military diplomatic influence carve piece china economic goal enormous cause national shame chinese history chinese communist party opened free market reform intention becoming western style democracy human right le considered pain as CCP considered intellectual property theft problem chinese company lifeblood business done none going end well american administration administration kept ignoring issue manufacturing base dried rust belt rotted enough asshole finally stop enormous policy change deserves great credit killing qasem soleimani low cost high impact foreign policy national security move probably averted war fell stroke attacking troop iraq iranian regime went hubris told US nothing turn pride come fall paid little price killing showed iranian others region still force reckoned despite drawing military presence anti war seem counterintuitive genuinely seems major aversion starting military action day said honest american military industrial complex ever heard lifetime calling pentagon endless war money military contractor positive major one biggest problem president even bigger personality massive insecurity policy work necessary run country country especially huge country united state everything quick solution photo ops lip service praise seeking get bogged detail hack huge problem america played grand scale covid formulate national plan capable thinking macro sense seems focused instant gratification within news cycle instead long term goal simply work running sort large organization ,0.049350471932439154,0.42233760774744383

Trump being president has totally made people funnier. 

Maybe its more of a if-you-don't-laugh-you'll-cry scenario, but I genuinely think the average level of humour has gone up on social media - I can't remember if people are funnier in person or not, but I feel that's more dependent on your friend group anyway. 

Even serious political things have gotten funnier - the whole fake reservations for the rally thing? So much funnier than a protest or whatever people did in the bygone era of Obama and Bush. 

I think there's a ludicrousness to his entire presidency that hasn't really existed before. He's so, so outrageous and available that it's maybe a little easier to laugh at it. Even when people are genuinely concerned, it seems like more people are defaulting to humour rather than anger. 

Obviously that's all anecdotal and maybe I'm just more aware of social media nowadays, but I genuinely think there's been a lot more laughter considering how bad things have been. 

Our tolerance for shenanigans has risen dramstically, too. President insinuated he has the power to delay an election and remain in power? President dangerously  suggested we might cure a virus by disinfecting ourselves from the inside? Meh, sounds like a Tuesday.

Trump was initially portrayed to us a thoughtless buffoon who was going to kickstart WWIII because of a Twitter slap fight.

Look around you and really ask yourself: do you feel like we're any closer to WWIII? The answer should be no. Let's go down the list.

Trump has not gotten into a missile exchange with North Korea. Just the opposite, he has facilitated diplomatic talks between the leaders of the peninsula. Moon Jae-in even recommended Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize back in 2018. Even if that's merely an offhand comment, it's quite a compliment. Now, a lasting peace cannot be orchestrated by the US alone (certainly not by one POTUS), but it is a step in the right direction. While it's true that diplomatic talks have deteriorated, that is primarily due to Kim's stubbornness (and probably internal hostility from Juche hardliners) more than anything else. We can revisit this issue in a decade, but for now we seem to be moving away from a war on the peninsula.

We have generally disengaged from the Middle East. After expending tons of blood and treasure on costly, endless wars, we are finally starting to bring the troops home. Under Trump, we have avoided starting new, prolonged conflicts (i.e. Syria). This is something I would assume that the Anti-war types would appreciate more, but I've not heard much from them. On that note, a peace deal was struck between Israel and the UAE not long ago. While the UAE isn't the biggest dog in the neighborhood, it's still a good move that will likely draw other countries to the peace table.

Contrary to the notion that Trump is a lapdog for Putin (seriously, look at the sanctions placed on Russia since he took office), we have moved more troops to Eastern Europe, which ought to dissuade further funny business from Moscow. Trump does not want a war with Russia, but he also does not mindlessly hate NATO.

https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/07/29/thousands-of-troops-are-coming-home-from-germany-but-some-of-them-could-be-going-right-back/

One might be tempted to say that we are headed for war with China, which unfortunately may be true, but you have to step back and look at who the aggressor is. China has gotten into skirmishes with Indian troops. They've conducted drills for invading Taiwan. Perhaps most perplexingly, there's even been grumbling in China over their historic claim to the Russian port city of Vladivostok. This is all in addition to their history of aggression in the South China Sea, and their crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. (I recommend checking out China Uncensored for further info.)

The bottom line here is that if things between China and the US go sideways, it won't be because Trump got into a Twitter slap fight and decided to hit the nuke button because his feelings got hurt, or anything like that.",0,1,0,2020-09-11 03:09:11,1,address broad issue foreign policy initially portrayed u thoughtless buffoon going kickstart WWIII twitter slap fight look around ask feel closer WWIII answer let list gotten missile exchange korea opposite facilitated diplomatic talk leader peninsula moon jae even recommended nobel peace back even merely offhand comment quite compliment lasting peace cannot orchestrated US alone certainly POTUS step right direction true diplomatic talk deteriorated primarily due kim stubbornness probably internal hostility juche hardliner anything else revisit issue decade seem moving away war peninsula generally disengaged east expending ton blood treasure costly endless war finally starting bring troop home avoided starting new prolonged conflict e syria something assume anti war type appreciate heard note peace struck israel UAE long ago UAE biggest dog neighborhood still move likely draw country peace table contrary notion lapdog putin seriously look sanction placed russia since took office moved troop eastern europe ought dissuade funny business moscow want war russia mindlessly hate NATO http militarytimes news military thousand troop coming home germany could going right back tempted headed war china unfortunately true step back look aggressor china gotten skirmish indian troop conducted drill invading taiwan perhaps perplexingly even grumbling china historic claim russian port city vladivostok addition history aggression south china sea crackdown pro democracy demonstrator hong kong recommend checking china uncensored info bottom line thing china US sideways got twitter slap fight decided hit nuke button feeling got hurt anything ,-0.005991565905359009,0.3526403194506643

You can't simultaneously blame him both for Coronavirus and the current economic crisis, as the economic crisis is the result of the lockdowns which are the only solution for coronavirus. 

 He did make serious efforts, twarted by congress to bring back troops from Iraq and Afganistan, and he did defeat ISIS, quickly and effectively. There used to be constant terrorism in the US and Western Europe from 2015 to 2017, especially in France. All of that stoped once ISIS was defeated. 

 America became the biggest oil producer in the world, gaining it's energy independence from the Middle East. 

 Most other stuff is partisan and cultural, so it's stuff he delivered to his base, not something you can classify as objectively good. He massively slowed down the cultural and demographic change of the country. He reinvigorated American cultural nationalism, across class lines, made the white working class (many ex-Obama voters) into American identitarianism,  reduced immigration massively, both legal and illegal, he put a travel ban on majority muslim countries, he banned Chinese infiltrators, and even at the wall, the places where he replaced the old fencing with new one are much improved.

In recent news we saw Trump saying ""I downplayed it, and I always wanted to downplay it. I didn't want to create a panic."" We scavenged every toilet paper roll in sight and that was the CALM version. Imagine if he had said ""yup, it's bad. We're all gonna die."" Shit would have gone nuts. He closed off travel to China and other countries early on, with much backlash and claims of being racist against Chinese people by the Democrats, and he did his job and left the rest up to the state and local governments.

The border is a huge issue for human trafficking and drug trades. Some kids have been kidnapped at the border taken across and raped as many as 30 times in a single day. Attempting to stop this is alone one of Trump's greatest achievements. That doesn't even begin to talk about Trump capturing Ghilaine Maxwell as an informant to get an inside on the Epstein human trafficking. This is more of a guess and I don't have a source but is it a coincidence that Maxwell was arrested and protected and just a month or so later we found trucks with 30+ kidnapped children in them?

Answer:

You are not being pacified. America was becoming shitty for some time, but it was always just enough for people to stick their heads in the sand and ignore all the small things that kept adding up.  Occasionally, something big would pop up, and folks would be pissy about it, but nothing would change after voicing themselves, and everyone would put their heads back into the sand.

And this is how America has been functioning well before I was even born. It only got worse and worse. Sure, occasionally, we were given a ""cookie"" to appease everyone and keep everyone pacified. But that ""cookie"" served as a distraction, while many more things were happening. Moreso, there was nearly always the constant threat of having that ""cookie"" taken away, and that too was a distraction. 

Today, moderates (centralist) want me and every progressive to vote to go back to that nonsense. But honestly, as scary as Donald Trump is, I fear going back to the so-called ""normal"" because the truth is the everyday ""normal"" was not working in the first place.  The rich were getting richer, the poor were getting poorer, and everyone was just keeping their heads down. That was scary and maddening.  Why would I want to go back to that?

Today, Trump, the monster that he is, cannot be ignored. More than that, the establishment that empowers him and how things have been working (all this time) have never been more apparent. As a result, every day, ordinary citizens, my fellow Americans, have been engaged and unable to sleep through all of this. They have been participating, became active in current affairs, and are not putting their heads back in the sand.

Do you say the progressive movement will die if Trump is elected? I say, our numbers and our ideals have never been more mainstream and more brought to light since Donald Trump, a fascist conservative, has put the fear of God into more than 1/2 of you. It was the middle of the road, boiling frog, head in the sand, a mindset that had ever caused more harm than Trump ever did. Why would I want to go back to that nonsense?

No, we do not want to go back because going there was the problem, and it took a madman for my fellow Americans to wake up. I don't want you to go back to sleep.

Still have a lot to read and respond to!",0,36290,2,0,,"For the record, here's a short list of the Trump administration's achievements coming into 2020...

Economy:

Economic growth has averaged 2.6% under this administration, accounting for why the unemployment rate recently hit its lowest mark in 50 years. Trump administration policies, first and foremost being his signature tax cuts, helped our economy add more than seven million jobs — over half a million in manufacturing alone. (Notably, these were jobs that his economically inept predecessor, Barack Obama, insisted ""are just not going to come back."")

As a barometer for consumer and business confidence, stock-market records also provide greater net worth to that broad swath of Americans who are equity holders either directly or indirectly. At the close of 2019, the S&P 500 was up 29%, the NASDAQ Composite was up 35%, and even the heavily loaded Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22%. And prospects look good going forward.

Wages for American workers are rising, and the fastest rise is for low-income workers. In addition, poverty rates for African-Americans and Hispanic Americans have reached all-time lows. As The Wall Street Journal notes, ""Wages for rank-and-file workers are rising at the quickest pace in more than a decade, even faster than for bosses. ... Average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers in the private sector were up 3.7% in November from a year earlier.""

After seeing their hourly earnings stumble along at 2.5% in Barack Obama's best years, life is once again looking up for middle-income earners!

Consumer spending has surged, a reflection of consumer confidence that is itself a reflection of Trump administration policies. The cancerous 2008 recession, which was seeded by Democrat policies, is now clearly in recession!

Trade:

For the first time in decades, our nation's workers have a president who is implementing trade deals to protect their jobs. And the House just approved President Trump's United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement trade pact, estimated to provide significant benefits to workers, farmers, and manufacturers. Trump's hardline trade stance with China has been politically risky among certain key constituencies, but a balancing of that trade relationship was long overdue and much needed to protect American jobs, our economy in the long term, and our national security. Trump had the brash and brawn to take China on!

According to The Hill, ""As a new year dawns in America, many of the nation's manufacturing sectors are experiencing aggressive growth. ... The steel industry in particular offers ample evidence, with America's steel companies investing some $13 billion in new steelmaking and mills across the nation. This isn't what many economists predicted, however. And frustrated by the flow of such positive news, the economics profession is looking for other means to wage their war against tariffs.""

The Regulatory State:

Trump has rolled back an impressive 8.5 government regulations for every new one implemented, saving American taxpayers more than $50 billion and spurring additional economic growth. According to The Washington Times, ""The Federal Register for Dec. 31 has published 2,964 final rules in its pages, the lowest number since records began in 1975."" Trump thus broke his previous record low of 3,281 in 2017.

The Trump administration has also cut almost 100 oppressive environmental regulations. And our air isn't any less breathable, nor our water any less drinkable.

The Courts:

The Senate confirmed 187 Trump-nominated judges, meaning that 20% of the federal bench is now occupied by Trump nominees. This includes two outstanding Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. If Trump is reelected, his conservative revitalization of the federal courts will continue, including possibly two more SCOTUS appointees. (With gratitude to former Democrat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who nuked the Senate's filibuster rule for judges in 2013 and thereby paved the way for Republican appointees ever since.)

Healthcare:

The Trump administration continues to implement policies that advance patient rights and slow healthcare cost increases, as they roll back Obama's so-called ""Affordable"" Care Act and its disastrous impact on medical care and costs. Successes include the largest year-over-year decline in drug prices ever recorded.

Energy:

The administration's energy policies have made the United States a net exporter of all oil products, including both refined petroleum and crude oil, for the first time in decades. This has resulted in reduced dependence on Middle Eastern oil and a weakening of Russia's export revenue.

Domestic Security:

Our nation is safer with Trump having reached new agreements with Mexico and Central American countries to help stem the flood of illegal immigrants across our southern border. Border apprehensions have since fallen by more than 70%, and the administration has replaced ""catch and release"" with ""catch and return,"" sending phony asylum seekers back to Mexico.

National Security:

America has enormous national-security challenges, but Trump, unlike his predecessor, is not appeasing tyrants. The administration has authorized our military to squash the Islamic State in the Middle East, unlike the prior administration's policies, which allowed jihadi terror to flourish. Additionally, by the end of 2020 our NATO allies will have increased defense spending by $130 billion — a good start. We also withdrew from the UN Arms Trade Treaty and the terrible ""nuke deal"" with Iran. Clearly, Trump has imposed a ""new deal"" on Middle East terrorists, including those from the most significant state sponsor of terrorism, Iran.

And finally, perhaps the worst news of all for Democrats: Despite their impeachment charade — or because of it — Trump's popularity is growing, and he is now the choice among voters against all 2020 Democrat contenders.

It is my hope that in January 2021, President Trump will again affirm his oath ""to support and defend"" according to Article II, Section 1, Clause 8, of the Constitution of the United States: ""I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""

Unlike congressional Democrats, Donald Trump has abided by his oath to the great benefit of Liberty and the American people he serves.

Every president signs thousands of bills into law, so pointing out inconsequential bills (that really don’t matter in the context of leading the most powerful nation on earth) and saying “he did it” is not really that interesting. The question to me is really a 3-part test:

1. Was it something Trump was instrumental in achieving? (Or would it probably have happened either way?)
   Good example: space force. probably wouldn’t happen without him. 
   Bad example: employment- it was basically on the same trajectory as it was under Obama, until the pandemic. 
2. Is it material? (in the context of the overall federal budget, structure or organization of the government, or society writ large?)
   Good example: tax reform, a multi-trillion dollar decision.
   Bad example: increasing school choice by $42 million- that’s literally a rounding error for the department of education budget.
3. Was it positive? (probably depends on your view of the world).

So.... here’s a list that I think potentially pass all three, as someone who finds him pretty loathsome.

1. engaging america in a frank and direct way via twitter, and throwing old dogmas aside. His motives are always suspect but he has rightly shifted our strategic focus to countering china, an incredibly repressive authoritarian state, and he helped changed the public’s view on them and made businesses question doing business there. i don’t love his methods but i think it’s right to point out that they’ve stolen our IP and are posing a challenge to the western order.
2. Tax “reform” WAS good for corporate earnings which boosted share prices a bit. It also actually wasn’t really as good for rich people as the democrats say (i say this as a rich person- deductions are smaller and less prevalent).
3. killing suleimani - let’s be real, obama foreign policy wasn’t particularly assertive and they were scared of their shadows. Most foreign policy experts on both sides would agree obama was not a huge foreign policy success. Of course Iran responded in a highly measured way- the US has escalation dominance vs Iran- they aren’t suicidal.

Trump has put major pressure on China, which is probably the largerst contribution to the things we hate the most. They kill people that do not agree with them. If you disagree with something china is doing it. 

I think Trump is very stubborn but he also doesn't let main stream media dictate his actions. Which is good. He does lack empathy, especially for my people that are of latin decent.

So I will point out the one thing that you can’t deny about Trump. His presidency has sparked a change in America. Whether this is positive or not is yet to be seen, but the optimist in me believes his presidency is, at worst, a necessary evil that made the people fight for their country back. 

Things were not good before Trump. Our freedoms are being eroded at an unprecedented pace. There’s global sex trafficking. A whole shit load of criminal activity in Washington I don’t fully understand. The one thing I know about congress is most politicians don’t give a single shit about you, and only care about maintaining their power. Having such a blatantly corrupt president is forcing the people of America to seriously look at their government for the first time in my life at least. And while Trump is getting grilled by the media and the people, other corruption is getting exposed. We can now see how McConnell and republicans disregard their duty to the people to maintain their power. Same with Nancy and the Dems. 

I guess this isn’t a factual sentiment to change your view.

I generally approve presidents who can keep the US going without screwing me over.

Honestly, I view Trump's presidency as the only decent one in my adult life. My taxes went down and I saw the most advancement in my field since graduating in the early 2010's. Most industries were doing well until the pandemic hit, but this is a global issue and not something Trump did so I can't fault him for that. Long story short, I pay less in taxes and have no personal complaints during his 3.5 years of service.

Obama screwed up my entire health insurance situation. I had a good plan, it got switched with the ACA and it cost me significantly more to have the same plan for me and my family. Obamacare was a good idea, but terrible in practice. His plan was rushed and not thought out so it screwed over a lot of people who already had health insurance. 

Bush gets the blame for being there during the housing market crash and recession. This put a huge dent in my college fund (there wasn't much left to use when I had to pay for school), and the job market was awful when I graduated college.
