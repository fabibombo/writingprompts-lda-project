1- He's donated his entire presidential salary to a variety of causes every year since his inauguration- VAs, education services and plenty more.

2- He convinced the Mexican government to modernise its labour laws as part of a trade treaty. Mexicans can now unionise properly! Could be argued that this doesn't affect the US, but I think that a happier and more well-protected workforce in a trade partner country will have benefits.

3- He started positive reforms to the prison system with the First Step act.

4- he killed (not personally) Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Honourable mention: SPACE FORCE. Worth it for the name alone, and he gave the rest of the world a good laugh.

Of course, none of this makes up for completely trashing the (ahem) formerly positive international reputation of the US, but there you go.

Trump signed the biggest wilderness protection & conservation bill in a decade and designated 375,000 acres as protected land.

Now we have better implementations. But the news won't tell you that.

I frankly usually say this as a joke, but you know, there really is some serious truth to it.

We need new thoughts in America. We need new perspectives and we need young people to get involved. That doesn't happen if they don't believe they can make a difference, and being president certainly allows them to make a big difference.

Now, after Trump, when they look around and see someone who doesn't fit the traditional political mold, who (IMO at least) isn't qualified for the job, it lowers the bar. That's a bad thing generally, but maybe in this case it makes some kid say ""hey, maybe I DO have a chance, I don't necessarily need to be a Harvard grad or a war hero or something really tough like that to be president"", and maybe that kid turns out to be a fantastic president.

Giving up before a fight even begins because you think you have no chance is a horrible thing. Trump shows people that truly ANYONE could be president, so they'll be more willing to start that journey. And, even if they ultimately fail, they may do some good in the process anyway.

Trump lowering the bar means that I'm no longer lying to my kids when I say they really can be president if they want, and that's a lasting positive.";1;13;0;2020-09-11 00:12:14;13

His motivations may or may not have been off center, but the CCP is a tyrannical regime that deprives its people of basic liberty and human rights and they have been systematically destroying the economies of other countries by dumping goods at less than cost to both destroy local industry and get people addicted to artificially cheap goods. It’s the new opium. Not to mention the fentanyl they also export. That regime is every bit as deadly as Hitler’s Germany we just have not come to the realization. The world had been if the mindset of Chamberlain (just give Europe away to keep peace and prosperity; vs let Hong Kong’s freedom erode, Taiwan’s claim to independence go unrecognized, and give away the South China Sea). Trump did a piss poor job with his go it alone approach. But it was critical that the world start standing up to China. It’s pretty clear to me that Trump’s motives aren’t well centered though because he idolizes Putin and Russia, who would subvert the world into a thuggish corrupt cleptocracy if they could. But too many former leaders refused to stand up to the CCP. That is a single change from Trumps presidency which likely will be a positive going forward.";10;117;0;2020-09-10 19:04:26;117

These are A few of my favorites and why I am pleasantly surprised with his presidency.  The truth is that there is a long list of his accomplishments that would surprise almost anyone but the major media networks still want you to believe that he is a ‘foreign asset’ despite America first being his number one platform as a politician. 

Either trump is as terrible as so many people claim, (hitler with bad hair) or he’s made a lot of formerly powerful people very angry and we are finally seeing how dirty politics can get in a real fight rather than having two parties who serve the same puppet masters.

People used to openly talk about how corrupt politics is and how that’s just the way it is... but now that an outsider has come in he is the most corrupt president ever?  Really?    The only thingS I know for certain are that I have no clue what’s Really going on but I know that the people who are supposed to inform us are most certainly not giving It to us straight.

I think for his own mouth but the media as well. I am going to label one point here, that's going to be long but I want it to be because it is the exact reason for why you think Trump hasn't done anything. Media narrative and confirmation bias. 

I will use the example of the crack down on illegals. Obama was the absolute [""Deporter in Chief""](https://www.axios.com/immigration-ice-deportation-trump-obama-a72a0a44-540d-46bc-a671-cd65cf72f4b1.html), he just didn't want people to know about it. The media was fine with that too so they didn't really make issue with it. Trump is a racist for deporting less people though. 

I was so against his ""Build the Wall"" bullshit from the get-go. Mainly bc the worst of the US loved it and the media focused on them, making it seem worse, but also I think that as a business owner, if I can hire someone who will work harder for $10 over someone else who works at half the speed for $11, I felt I should be able to. I also don't blame illegals for coming here, in the least. But after realizing that it wasn't about racism as the media and his critics want you to think. It was about poor Americans getting a job. Black unemployment rate was the lowest it had [been in decades, maybe history](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000031) once Trump got his policies going.

If we were going to get the poor in this country back in the workforce, we had to make jobs for them. Since poor people usually start at jobs near the bottom, same as illegals, we had to clear out the people taking those jobs and thats exactly what happened.

The difference in the admins strategies is that Trump made it harder for people to get/stay on welfare bc he knew that there were jobs opening. While this may seem cruel and whatnot, people need a kick in the ass sometimes. Obama gutted the restrictions for welfare, allowing more of the poor to sit back and collect a check.  Trump didn't and the unemployment #s showed that across the board. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is think about what is going on and stop reading the news, especially headlines from Reddit. Because just like the ""Sturgis Was a Super Spreader"" headline, it's created with a narrative to make you feel a certain way. But if you read it, you will realize that it's total horseshit.";22;292;0;2020-09-10 18:48:27;292

And these 2 statistics are what most opened my eyes as a black man who grew up VERY poor. And i believe that the prison system systematically ruined generations of black families in the 90s.

Pre-covid the trump administration has been the best administration for the overall black community. (shockingly including obama)

1. Lowest black incarceration rates over the past 20 years
2. Lowest black unemployment rates during the same time-frame

Im not a trump supporter by any means. And im highly involved in the BRC in NYC and my fathers main charity provides low income home ownership opportunities to the black community.

But those 2 stats always stick out to me. The craziest thing is, i know he himself didn't push for any law to directly influence these numbers. From what ive seen its just been a bi-product of a bunch of other shit he has been doing.

He also gave the rebels in Syria enough weapons to start the civil war causing millions of refugees and thousands deaths.

He does have some achievements worth noting.

Trump helped broker fully normalized relations between the UAE and Israel.  This is a big deal for the  middle east.


BBC.com/news/world-us-canada-54092960


It's a big enough deal that a Norwegian politician nominated Trump for a Nobel peace prize for his role in the normalized relations and stated that he should be judged on the facts of the action and not ""on the way he behaves sometimes.""  He likely won't win one, but I'd love to see leftist heads explode if he did.   I don't think I could handle the righteous right gloating though... 


Reducing our dependence on China with matching tarrifs during a time the Chinese government is increasingly expansionist and flouting of human rights is something I agree with.  He may say stupid shit like calling Xi Xinping a great leader, but he's maintained the military pivot to Asia and offering assurance to our allied Asian nations.  His actions aren't in line with his verbal praise of Chinese leadership.


Many of his ""accomplishments"" will also be good or bad depending on your political views and what you think is right.  For instance, many of his religious freedom policies have been steps backward for US domestic social issues (he's anti-abortion).  I think because ""religion"" in the US is currently synonymous with Christian.  This needs to change and Trump has NOT helped this on the domestic side.


But, on the international stage he has publicly called out Nigeria for the killing of Christians during a conference call with Nigeria's President and has also criticized China for their persecution Uighur Muslims.  He's been consistently strong about backing religious freedoms on the international front.

His domestic and social policies suck.  He's divisive which is not what we need.  His biggest weakness is that he's knee-jerk combative in a childish way and doesn't know how to de-escalate.

Didn't every recent president since Clinton or earlier promise to move to US Embassy to Jerusalem, but then backed out fearful of Palestinian backlash? Trump did it without blinking an eye.


For me, it was enough that Trump walked over the border into North Korea, fearless and unprotected - to the utter shock of the world who watched. And for a brief time there was hope for North South Korea unification and across Asia their was a pro-Trump love-fest that America was largely shielded from. In the USA, the MSN which had been running with Nuclear War narrative quickly shut the hell up and changed the subject.

He more of less destroyed ISIS by giving General Mattis a free hand (do you remember how bad the ISIS threat was prior to 2016? That's gone now!), 

He ordered the killing of Soleimani, and the entire middle east is better off for it. 

Even students in Iran started *walking around* ground-paintings of the American Flag - out of *respect* for America!

He changed the overton window on China, standing up to theft of American IP when everyone else was too gutless - this is just icing on the cake!


This list won't be believed because it's Trump's recent press release from the white house. If even 2% is true, I am sufficiently impressed.

He's been pushing back (well, our national security advisors) against foreign surveillance. It really is a huge benefit to US security. People don't understand why he's done things like attack TikTok, but they don't realize that TikTok has been involved with foreign intelligence to gather information on US citizens. This has been the case with other companies, and this administration is pushing back on every one they find.  


He's been doing more than former GOP presidents in the regard for attempting to lower healthcare prices. Hell, I'm extremely left on the healthcare issue, but the fact that a GOP member is trying to take steps in that direction is definitely worth mentioning. (just give us nationalized healthcare already, shit.)  


He's playing ball with Hong Kong. Removing the special status of Hong Kong has slighted China. I really appreciate the indirect support for Hong Kong, even if it was done only to piss of China. It's not necessarily great for Hong Kong, but in the long run, I believe it's being played out as a bargaining chip to help strengthen the democracy in Hong Kong.  


People on the left really don't look into Trump's administration, but I'm going to give you an example of confirmation bias really clouding reality, which is unfortunate. Trump actually signed an executive order pressuring the police forces in the US to stop using excessive force. Yes, the EO was very bureaucratic, but hopefully it has some effect. It would be hard to tell, anyway, because the media is not going to credit Trump with anything in this fight for police reform, and even right wing media won't talk about it either because it fucks up their own narrative and base. [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/19/2020-13449/safe-policing-for-safe-communities](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/19/2020-13449/safe-policing-for-safe-communities)  


This thing I'm going to mention is obviously going to be shrugged off, but try to give it some thought. The EPA and some other agencies were used as political action fronts for certain groups. Some of their powers were allowing them to rig certain things, like energy prices, energy production, etc. The conspiracy is that some of these were embedded with a function that allowed taxes to flow into other action fronts, by essentially taxing energy companies because they couldn't achieve impossibilities. When Trump was ""dismantling"" the EPA, what he was actually doing was cutting off these revenue streams and function of these fronts that really didn't do anything in terms of protecting the environment. The result is that it pissed off the team that put those in place, and made energy cheaper. It really had no effect on the environment either way, but it really stifled the Democrat power over energy. That's 100% why they threw a giant hoopla, ""they're going to get rid of the EPA!"" Which the GOP didn't. They just wanted to stop the DNC from using the regulatory ability of the EPA for their own political and globalist ideals.  


Trump has funded black colleges and universities more than any other president.  


I could keep going. I understand the guy is a terrible personality, and really makes our country look bad, but he's completely listening to advisors. That's the one thing I respect about Trump. He knows he's not the smartest guy (he's pretty dumb), and he knows he needs to hire the smartest people. Yes, they are conservative, but they are effectively running the country. No, I don't want Trump in office, but at least he hasn't been a lame duck, has been bolstering the shit out of US defenses, and is really being an A class conservative. There has been worse.   


If people start attacking me, saying that he's not running the country, our country is turning to shit.. Well. It's been turning to shit, regardless of the president. I didn't post this stuff to actually have an argument. Just look into it yourself and make your own decisions. I won't reply.";0;7;0;2020-09-11 02:34:36;7

There's a very long list of accomplishment trump has achieved, but I hope that I can offer a different approach that will eliminate the need for a reddit thread. Most of what I've seen here trump himself has spoken about at his state of the union speeches, press briefings, and his RNC acceptance speech. 

Sadly, due to social alienation and political division; almost all people who hate Trump will go as far as not trusting governmental research or advise (I.E. CDC, FDA, and certainly not White House press briefings.), and will simply dismiss it as lies because it's ""part of his administration."" This is why we're even doing this whole thread right now, there's too many people on the left side of the divide unwilling to even consider what the right says as anything more than lies, deceit, and evil. This is understandable, when the mostly left leaning mass media constantly drones on about what the right supposedly wants to do, proclaims it evil, racist, bigoted, sexist, and paints all of what a large number of people believe as fascist. 


It's important to hear the other side, not envelope ourselves in a bubble of our own egos. I was a liberal up until a month before the 2016 election. Too much has changed about the left since I was a child. It made sense when the right was a party of the types of people I am only now becoming more comfortable with; gun enthusiasts, military veterans, mechanics and tradesmen, devoted christians, and the general hard working union stiff. They used to intimidate me, confuse me, and upset me; but not because they wanted to. 


They did so because I didn't understand what they truly believed or why they did. Most of these people just want to make a good enough living to support themselves and their families, be able to protect themselves from threats to their families and communities, maintain safe communities through rule of law, but not have so many onerous regulations that it hurts the fruits of their labor. They don't have some grand vision of what's best for everyone else, and the one thing I've learned I resent most now as a minarchist libertarian is that someone else with no accountability thinks they can know best for millions of others, (basically bureaucrats) simply because they are ""intelligent."" Yes we need leaders, but I resent the ""intellectual"" as it's a dangerous path to lead letting a small group of people who will ultimately have their own biases and blindspots dictate policy without regard for others. This is why representative democracy is important; since the smaller districts require a more focused set of ideas that exist from those communities. 


Let me make my point (again) before I continue to ramble;


People who supported Trump are not ""evil."" The Trump administration is not 1 dimensional, nor is his support base. Conservatives are not out to get you. Talk to more of them (not just op, but all of you), and understand that they are people like you. They hold genuine beliefs about their lives and the lives around them, just like you do. If you don't feel you hold any ideals firm, then talk to someone about theirs so you can help solidify your own ego through attrition. Research. Don't trust mass media so readily, since most of their reporting is going to lean towards ""outrage."" They need to make their buck too. Empathize, stop sympathizing. A lot of people confuse those things. It takes a hot minute to clear your mind of your bias and truly consider how and why people you don't agree with come to the conclusions they have.

So let's look at the positives of the Trump presidency. There's a lot to look at. 

1. The USA - China trade war. This has been devastating for China. It's impossible to know just how damaged the Chinese economy is, but good sources are saying it is crippled and the Chinese regime is desperate. 

2. On the flip side, the US economy was booming, right up until Covid-19 hit. The economy was going from strength to strength. From the S&P500 to small local businesses pretty much everyone in America was on a high. 

3. He killed public enemy number 1. 

4. The Iranian economy has been fucked. A weak Iran gives America amazing leverage in the middle east. Enough perhaps to withdraw troops. Which brings us to. 

5. Withdrawing troops from Syria and Iraq. Continuing the Obama era plan to had over policing of the Middle East to Saudi Arabia and Isreal. Beinging American troops home. 

6. Continued the downwards trend of violent crime, right up until the BLM protests. 

7. Revealed the extent of the failure of the MSM at providing unbiased fair journalism. 

8. By doing nothing he's accidently made America the best country in the world to live through Covid. By not locking down and not trying to stop the spread, America has managed to escape the worst of the economic issues if Covid-19,  while also having a lower death rate than most comparative European countries AND enjoy the luxury of avoiding a second spike with a second spate of lockdown and a second spate of layoffs.";1;10;0;2020-09-10 22:51:14;10

Deptuizing state police in Washington in order to properly convict violent rioters without violating the states rights. Which will hopefully spell the end to (mostly peaceful lol) riots that have killed over 30 people since March.

I was having a conversation with my friend the other day about how frustrating it is knowing that there are *zero* resources for an objective analysis of Trump's presidency. I'm a pretty solidly-left person, so naturally I despise the guy and everything he represents, but I also study law and politics and sometimes just want to know *what* he's done. It's nearly impossible to find out -- any source that talks about his activities positively is going to be some hideous right wing website littered with clickbait ads titled ""The TRUTH About Feminism EXPOSED"" with absolutely no hint of objectivity that make facially absurd claims like ""Trump is actually the BEST president America has ever had, especially for black people!"". Meanwhile, other sources are ... well, the predominantly center-left media apparatus which is in histamine response mode, flaring up and focused on nothing more than rejecting the virus.

Combine that with that fact that social media is nothing but pre-decided narratives that can't even agree over basic facts and it becomes nearly impossible to synthesize any truth out of the whole thing. It's really frustrating for someone who just want so know the facts.";4;12;0;2020-09-10 20:55:47;12

As an African American he has brought to light what a great majority of us have always known. That there is a whole lot of racism. This is the bedrock of this nation and a great many of its white citizens. It has brought us out of our delusion and back to reality that this is a constant fight on a lot of fronts.

I think as a group we now know we must be pro-active at every level of government to root this kind of evil out. Not just vote every 4 years for a president. But every election at state and local levels.

Second, I think just as an American the rot of the system has donkey kicked the people in the face as to how bad politicians are at doing their job. We have to be active participants in getting the real things the people need not just the priveleged few. Which means we need to look at policies not people.

The American people have in effect become sloths that were oblivious to the ills of our society nc we were busy being distracted and now Trump has brought many of us back to focus on things we need to do to right this country.

Trump may have accidentally become the thing we needed in my opinion. I've had this opinion before he got elected. Knowing that this was a corrupt system. The lame two party system that spouts rhetoric with no meaning. The out of control corporations that poison us with no regard except more profits. The justice system that habitually punishes the poor whether they black, latino, or whites. Health system that just sucks. A religious fascism that has always been around. A racist far right or just right that finally did away with coded rhetoric. A neo-liberal left that's just Republican light. With both parties serving corporations not citizens. 

He was never the real problem but he surely put everything on Front Street for all to see. Now it's who's on what side and what actions that we take. There is a whole lot of old systems that need to be broken down. 

So to me Trump has done good accidentally. His awoken the people to action.

I am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.

Edit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.

Edit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.

Well, I don't recall seeing a single trending popular post for the [Save Our Seas Act](https://apnews.com/2d5947a8bd924adc9f0ab077177fabdd). Amd you probably haven't even heard of the [Great American Outdoors Act](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/management/2020/08/what-the-great-american-outdoors-act-can-do/) because Reddit lied to you and tried calling it the ""Trump wants to release methane in to the world"" or whatever. The left wing media also blasted Trump for wanting to [trim forests to prevent wildfires](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/eo-promoting-active-management-americas-forests-rangelands-federal-lands-improve-conditions-reduce-wildfire-risk/) but conveniently forgot his administration pushed a huge [wilderness protection bill](https://www.newsweek.com/wilderness-protection-bill-donald-trump-sign-environment-largest-death-valley-1361412). Trump's Affordable Clean Energy bill also got a lot of flak for not being as restrictive as Obama's, but that's because the New York Times conveniently forgot they ran an article about how [Supreme Court blocked Obama's legislation from doing anything in the first place](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/us/politics/supreme-court-blocks-obama-epa-coal-emissions-regulations.html). Heck you know what you should do. Google Trump & windmill, you'll get hundreds of hits repeating the same articles claiming he hates windmills. But if you were alive in 2014, you'd know [people sued them over bird deaths](https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2014/05/14/wind-energy-projects-must-nagivate-rules-protect-birds/9070505/) and [Trump nixed that](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/27/573845851/accidentally-killing-birds-isnt-a-crime-says-trump-administration). And while Trump has cut a bunch of repopulated animals from the endangered list, a [species of bees was added](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/insects/rpbb/FAQsFinalListing.html). It's not just some kind of groundwork for the first series of bee protection, it skips a lot of red tape and forces people to take care of bees if the species is in the area now instead of later. And even TheHill's was so impressed their largest complaint about [Trump's NASA plans was they didn't see it coming](https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/514278-trump-offers-promises-for-the-space-force-and-nasa-for-the-second-term)

We could also talk about the court appointments being life long, or [maybe how the average working person made more money in 2018 than ever before](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-delivered-record-breaking-results-american-people-first-three-years-office/).

I think it's more fair to look at what campaign promises has Trump kept. Specifically because those are things he said he was going to do.

Here's the list:

Trump signs resolution to reverse Obama's executive order on gun control.

President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum officially directing the United States to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, making good on a signature if not symbolic campaign promise.

President Donald Trump made his way to the White House promising his administration would be one to enforce laws -- and also one to get rid of excessive legislation.

Trump nominates Neil Gorsuch to fill empty Supreme Court seat left by Scalia.

Trump says U.S. pulling out of Paris climate agreement.

Create a 10-percent repatriation tax. The new repatriation tax rate isn't 10 percent, but it's close. Under the bill that passed, U.S. businesses that are holding assets overseas would be allowed to repatriate those assets at 8 percent, or 15.5 percent for liquid assets.

Keep Guantanamo Bay Detention Center open.

Suspend immigration from terror-prone places.

Move U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

Limit legal immigration.

Create private White House veterans hotline.

Won't say 'Happy Holidays'.

Ask countries we protect to pay more for joint defense.

Reverse Barack Obama's Cuba policy.

Ensure funding for historic black colleges.

Defund Planned Parenthood.

Use U.S. steel for infrastructure projects.

Trump’s lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying for foreign governments still in effect.

Raise tariffs on goods imported into the U.S.

Increase veterans' health care.

Save the Carrier plant in Indiana.

Make no cuts to Social Security. Trump proposed cuts, but Congress didn’t bite

End the defense sequester.

Take no salary.

Some of these may be good, some of these may be bad. It's impossible to say what is good in your perspective.

For example, with our stance against China, I can't say I think it was a good idea we dropped out of the TPP, but you might think that leaving the TPP was a great idea.

Taxes are many companies’ largest expense. Even despite this fact, less than 5% of taxes generated came from corporate taxes each year. All of this to say, the US was driving companies to seek tax shelters in other countries, offshore jobs, and make US based businesses less price competitive on a global scale. The changes in tax law that Trump was able to pass will allow American businesses to compete better internationally while having a very minimal impact on overall tax revenue. In fact, the increase in businesses that stay in the US may even generate more tax revenue over the long haul.;0;5;0;2020-09-10 17:11:54;5

I am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.

Edit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.

Edit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.

 Typical Republican politicians don't do this because conservatives are generally uncomfortable with appeals that aren't universalist, they know that anything they do that touches race at all other than capitulate is going to get them called racist, and they likely buy into the same ""common knowledge"" among political elites that black people are destined to vote as a bloc. More diversity in the Republican party can bring more accountability to both parties by lessening the extent that the charge of racism can be used as a wedge issue. Making the funding restoration for historically black colleges permanent was a particularly helpful feature because it doesn't just help them, it takes that issue off the board so it can't be used as a wedge issue in the future and people can make their decision based on something other than perceived patronage. Both parties have these wedge issues that they give mouth service to (abortion is one for Republicans) but clearly have an incentive in never seeing solved because it lets them make people swallow a lot of shittiness and then say ""what are you doing to do, let the baby killers/racists have power?""";0;2;0;2020-09-10 20:11:04;2

I haven't heard much about them threatening to use nuclear weapons in a while. Also the tax cuts were nice, I wasn't affected by them too much, but more money is more money. I'm not super educated on local government politics, but as far as my experience goes it has been fully handled by the counties, which have made all of the decisions regarding the lockdown, I really don't think that Trump is the reason why the pandemic has been so poorly handled. They have been choosing which things open and close during the pandemic. Not to mention the anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers who have been completely disregarding safety measures, I really think that it's unfair to just blame one person. He has done some bad stuff, such as the tensions in the middle east, but I haven't seen people referring to those things when they get upset at him. Maybe I just need better insight, idrk, but I would need more examples I guess. I don't exactly have good experiences with political subs, so I'm trying to make this the very chill, and just asking for some insight from the other side y'know? I just feel like people are just looking so hard for stuff that they're making up weird accusations and doing these mental gymnastics to credit him for bad stuff, instead of looking at the stuff that's right in front of them. I'm don't really support him, I just think that Biden and Hillary are worse choices. I wish we could have had a more mild choice, politics seem to be so wildly shifted one way or the other, and it's really annoying, I don't think he's being treated the same as other presidents. Last point here, I think that he showed us just how biased our media sources are. Before I felt like CNN and FOX were very unbiased and trustworthy sources, but now, I just feel like making my own news report.;0;1;0;2020-09-10 21:12:42;1

Both sides think they are positive and the other negative.  No one steps in to the ring thinking they are the loser.  That being said...


He has managed to unify not only the folks that support or will vote for him, but those that don't.  To be able to organize not only your side but your opponents side single handily, is an impressive feat in my opinion.  More people will turn out to vote this year then ever before.  More people are getting involved, and taking action, organizing and speaking up because of him and even his opponents have no one else to thank but him, because their differences are being cast aside for a common enemy.  Love em, hate em, it's all the same.  More people will vote in the next 8 weeks then have ever voted before. That alone is amazing.

He pushes people.  He triggers them.  He makes them show their hand, and undoes a lot of facade.  Our elected officials can no longer hide behind the scenes and their filters.  He exposes their priorities and makes them wear their shame.  It doesn't matter if he gets reelected or not.  His presence has ushered in a well deserved and much needed change.  Politics will never be the same, and the old ways are fading.  Newer era progressives and capitalists are making leaps into the fray and igniting fires the likes congress has never seen.  Hes made not only us face ourselves in the mirror and make changes, he's challenged deep seated corrupted politicians and proved to them that they are not untouchable.  The miserable old misers are being left behind by younger more involved and innovative thinkers.

People are relying less and less on what the news tells us.  We are seeking the truth in everything we see or hear, and not relying on doctored documents and articles to tell us how to think or feel.  We are studying and researching and sorting facts from fiction, and we are no longer satisfied with just accepting what we are told.  Again...Donald Trump.

As far as the global community, and their opinions of him,  before they call this pot black, they need to look in the mirror and remember how kettle they are.  America barely qualifies as a gen z next to countries like Russia or China.  Their deep seated hatred and disgust comes from their own denials of their own history.  And not only has Donald Trump got americans for and against him rallying, hes got people all over the world pushing towards a new way forward.  This is something no single person in the known areas of history has accomplished.  New blood is popping up all over.  People we have never even heard of are making moves to make a difference.  Thier views under a level of magnification like no other because of him.  The whole world is watching him, and watching each other closer then ever before.  No more turning a blind eye.  

love em, hate em, it doesn't matter...tonight just his name mentioned got you talking, and asking questions, and thinking deeply about the things that really matter, and what we can do to fix the things that are so wrong.  Yes he's done some specifically impressive things.  Yes he has done the equal and opposite of those things as well.  Get out and vote, have the talks and discussions.  Say how you really feel, and be free doing it.  Just because you don't like what you see or hear doesnt make it wrong.  Understanding and compassion are shared on both sides of a battlefield, and in the end, remember we are all someones children.";0;2;0;2020-09-11 01:33:54;2

2. He didn’t get us into another pointless war and he withdrew troops from Iraq while allowing effective airstrikes on ISIS and other terrorist groups. His command killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS.

3. He helped negotiate a historic peace deal between Israel and the UAE.

4. He signed the CARES Act which was the largest stimulus bill ever signed in the US and gave millions of Americans financial support. It also supported small businesses.

5. He signed the USMCA which replaced NAFTA (roughly the same, but slightly better for the US and Mexico).

6. He has a tough stance on China which is beneficial to the entire world and raises awareness to the dictatorship that the Chinese government is running.

7. He created the Space Force (more of just moving certain Air Force capabilities to a new branch, but it gives those personnel more autonomy and room for growth).

I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.

The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well.

A lot of people in this thread are talking about stuff Trump did as positive accomplishments.  The guys tasked with laying minefields around Cambodia, they probably ended each day feeling like they made a positive accomplishment.  I don't think they were all thinking ""I'm very proud of this thing which will randomly maim people and ruin lives for the next century"".  Most of what Trump has done is lay minefields for future politicians.  From the start, the people who are backing and advising Trump are small-government Tea Partyists and fundamental christians who want state-run psuedo-theocracies and no federal government.

 I think the only positive we'll see out of this will be the historical reaction to this catastrophic presidency.  Every single thing he has done has caught the attention of people who know there's a better way.  In the same way that WWII led to the cold war, which led to the space race, which created a generation of nerds, which led to the computer revolution, which allowed us to map the genome and cure diseases...in a long enough timeline, Hitler's monstrosities becomes crucial to saving millions of lives.  Perhaps he will be seen as the last dying gasp of a shitty status quo making room for a new world.Maybe after this we'll shift our culture away from limitless capitalization and industrialization and fix the planet.  Maybe we'll see a cultural revolution where the proletariat overthrow the ruling class, or in some other way fix the wealth disparity in the world.  Maybe we'll all realize Twitter and social media does for communication what McDonalds does for health. But it's too early to know.

It's literally easier for me to point to things Hitler did historically right, because Hitler was both evil and competent.  Trump is evil and *incompetent* and he's therefore being manipulated and enabled by the GOP.   It's hard to point to anything as an ""accomplishment"" when it seems that most of his personally-generated executive orders are just undoings of Obama's. By personal admission his entire cabinet was chosen because they have a desire to collapse the government.  Hell, the FEC can't even oversee this election because he hasn't appointed enough members for  them to have a quorum.  Most of what he does is act as a figurehead, lightning rod, distraction, and overall agent of chaos.  I will say that raising the China issue with the american public is probably deserved.  Their central government is worse than ours, and ours is intolerable.

Pretty much everything else he did personally his entire life was terrible, flawed, tainted, or bad for reasons the right is refusing to acknowledge.   Even his interpersonal familial love feels tainted and discolored. I would say that his fundamental MO is to mortage the long-term health of the country in trade for short-term profitability for the ruling class.  People in this thread are giving him credit for signing bills that he 1) didnt' create, 2) didn't endorse, and 3) didn't understand, because they too don't read the bills. 

For example, lots of people point to his work with N. Korea. Visiting Kim Jong Un ONLY benefits Trump and Kim Jong Un; he thinks its a feather in his cap towards peace and doesn't realize that being recognized by a world leader only gives legitimacy and job security to a third world dictator.  They only exist because China supports them, and they ransom nuclear attack for food.  Sure, we now produce more oil than Canada, but we did so by removing environmental regulations designed to prevent us from drowning in our waste products.  But he signed a $10,000,000 ""Save our Seas"" act, so when Exxon causes a trillion-dollar oil spill due to lax regulations, we'll have an underfunded agency which will clean up the Dawn Soap bottles floating next to the dead pelicans.

Edit- he also renegotiated some great trade deals with Korea and redid NAFTA. His trade war with China has damaged their economy. He reneged the Iran nuclear deal ans has curtailed the regimes ability to build nuclear weapons. He has rebuilt the American military and put us in a position of strength again. 

Addendum to the above comment on foreign wars. He has utilized restraint while still insuring that, unlike Obama, his red lines are not crossed.

Trump, at first, seemed to actually be anti-war. He described how he was in a meeting and he expressed how he wanted to end or significantly cut down on the fighting in Syria after ISIS lost their territory. He said the entire room exploded in outrage, he said that 'these people' (I want to say generals and advisors) only want war, only think about war. War war war.

&#x200B;

You know what? I ab-so-lutely believe him. He's not the first person who was on the inside who told us this kind of stuff, just how hawkish the government and the military industrial complex really is.

&#x200B;

But he ultimately didn't do anything about, he walked back his commitments. It's a real shame. I disliked Trump, but his hands are on the wheel and I was hoping he would make a right turn.  He had a chance, he told the truth about our wars, but ultimately did nothing.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed that so that only $10,000 of state and local taxes can be deducted. The effect of this is to raise taxes on wealthy earners in high tax states, making the tax code more progressive (Mitch McConnell, progressive hero). Housing prices in these rich areas have fallen, allowing some more people to move to those areas. All in all, it was a great detail of a bad bill;1;1;0;2020-09-10 22:51:18;1

Donald Trump is a populist. Generally, he says things like medical care should be less expensive, capped, whatever but refuse to do anything to get there. He says we should have clean air and clean water but his administration increased the allowable amount of toxins in our water and he’s selling untouched Alaskan wilderness for gas. He says he’d like to see criminal justice reform but won’t actually do anything to improve it. He even decreased federal protections against financial advisor who lie to their clients to make more money.

He’s also the first president in decades to not drag us into an armed conflict. Did all of this despite the fact that the Democrats were attempting to impeach Trump from the moment he took his hand off the Bible.

Also the first president to support gay marriage before entering office, Obama did not even support gay marriage until midway through his re-election campaign.

People are laughing that he was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, but Obama won one and Trump has done way more for world peace than Obama ever did. There’s the old joke that Obama won the prize for not being George Bush, but that’s a stupid and dishonest justification because he basically was George Bush.

Most of what you see about president Trump is people grasping for straws and in many cases outright lying. Reddit and Twitter are just echo chambers where anyone can say anything bad about trump and it will be echoed and amplified. Trump will be remembered a lot better than people think he will. Everyone is devolving into tribalists, taking the attitude that “if Trump does something it must be bad because it’s Trump!” And if you’re reading this and that sounds like you would unironically say, you shouldn’t be voting.

I am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.

Edit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.

Edit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness.

That's something specific I can think of on a quite short list.  Of course, he took credit for the original idea and didn't mention that it was effectively a renewal and extension of the original one (i.e. he lied about its origins), so he still managed to tarnish it.

https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/09/07/superfund-activists-donald-trump-minden-wv-400921

Titled *The One Incredibly Green Thing Donald Trump Has Done.* Trump’s EPA has remediate more Superfund sites in a year than any other administration has since 2001. It’s still a bit
of a mixed bag, where white neighborhoods were disproportionately prioritized, and they’ve completely ignored orphan sites, but a cleanup of a toxic waste dump is undoubtedly a good thing, and he’s done more than any president since Clinton with the program. Trump’s EPA has also been ruthless in refusing to settle for less penalties with the responsible parties, in a way no other administration has ever been, and that is a spectacular thing. Taxpayers should not be bailing out criminal corporations and government agencies. They should either pay up or be liquidated. 

I grew up within five miles of three of these noxious sites. I have zero sympathy for these heinous criminals, whether it’s a chemical company or the Navy.  These sites are responsible for thousands of slow, painful poisoning  deaths each. They’re corporate serial killers, and they should be thanking us profusely for not throwing everyone involved into a fucking gulag where they belong, instead of just fining them some worthless paper for a complete cleanup.  If it were up to me, I’d make the CEOs and generals clean up the waste with their bare hands like in the Handmaid’s Tale.

I won’t credit him with the Great American Outdoors Act or any other legislation of that nature — it is not some grand accomplishment to not veto a bill with overwhelming support. I also won’t credit him with any promotion of peace — his Iran policy has been a fucking trainwreck of dangerous brinksmanship, and it’s only luck and the Iranian government‘s wisdom that has prevented it from escalating to WW3.";0;1;0;2020-09-11 00:38:21;1

I heart the Republican media talk about Obama’s vacation for 8 years and before that the Democratic media killed Bush #2. All presidents do this. People hate the other side so much that they won’t even acknowledge a single ounce of good. Fixing NADTA was a good thing and so was funding HBCUs in perpetuity. How they weren’t funded before this president is beyond me. Maybe write a letter to your congressman. I think holding China accountable is a big step. If you want to know where the American middle class went just look to China. He is in no way what we would consider presidential personally but I think he has done some good things for the country.

I don’t even like the guy as person but this whole thing is an obvious example of someone only watching one side of news...

He’s funded the national parks and given money to make all repairs.

He’s donated every dime of his president’s pay to different charities and education funds. 

Moved the embassy to Jerusalem.

Deductions for average Americans on taxes.

Froze student loan interest.

More recently got the UAE and Israel to sign a peace treaty and more countries in the area will follow suite since the UAE did it. His son in law played a big hand in that personally. 

Prison reform.

Attempted police reform. 

Gave Mattis what he needed to defeat isis.

Got rid of Soleimani. 

Easily the most anti war president we’ve had in generations. 

This is just what I know off the top of my head. Sure he’s a loud mouth, and personally I don’t care what “damage he’s done to our reputation” world wide. As people from other countries were taking advantage of our kindness and world presence anyways. But he’s not that bad as a president.

I am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.

Edit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.

Edit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.

1.  He's donated his entire  presidential salary to a variety of causes every year since his  inauguration- VAs, education services and plenty more.   Obama did not.

2.   He convinced (threatened / forced / bullied ) the Mexican government to drastically tighten up security on their southern border.    This caused a major decrease in illegal immigration.

3.  Peace between Israel and UAE.   Everyone said moving the Embassy to Jerusalem was gonna light an islamic radical fire...yeah not.    Obama managed to turn Libya into a modern open air slave market, good, eh ?

4-  He changed rules of engagement so our guys could way, way, way more effectively fight ISIS, result ISIS was crushed in a matter of months.   Obama rules of engagement were getting our guys killed to preserve civilians.

5.   He has exposed the corruption at the highest levels of NSA / FBI...we don't want politicians spying on their rivals.   If Hillary won, the spying would never have been exposed, and we can save time and forgo future elections because if your opponent has all your campaign staff emails, phone calls, texts...you can't win.   

6.   He has exposed the extreme bias in our media, soooo many of them spewing crap all day about russia collusion...turned out there was ZERO EVIDENCE OF ANY COLLUSION.   It never happened.

7.   At least they have started on the Wall.

8.    Clinton, Bush, Obama.   24 YEARS of China stealing our intellectual property and jobs.    Finally Trump calls them out on it...";0;1;0;2020-09-11 01:10:57;1

He finally gave us maternal/paternal leave (something Obama said he would do but didn’t) for the first time, and he gave us the biggest annual pay raise I’ve seen in my career. He also signed an executive order calling for federal hiring reforms that I actually agree with and think are badly needed.

The first president sence Carter to do so. 

He literally got on good enough terms with north Korea that he stepped into north korea without any guards.  He is the first sitting president of the United States to ever do this.

He ended nafta, this was so beneficial to the United States that Joe Biden now claims to always have been against nafta, even though he supported it at the time.

He baned critical race theory in government organizations, this will put an end to the racism of low expectations of claiming time is a white construct and poc can't be expected to be held to the same standards as white people.

I would also argue his divisiveness has activated more people pushing them ether to vote for or against him.  This is generally a good thing if you want people to take part in their government.";0;1;0;2020-09-11 02:04:58;1

1. As a conservative, I'm happy about his appointing of **Gorsuch and Kavanaugh**.
2. The Iran deal Obama made still allowed enrichment of uranium which can be used to make nuclear weapons, so I'm glad **he withdrew** from that. How a ""nuclear deal"" with Iran actually ever allowed this is kind of crazy. Isn't that why the deal was made?! That being said, his withdrawal from this deal is probably the least ""lasting"" of the positive impacts he's made. I suspect something will replace it sometime in the near future.

It designates particular geographical areas - mostly in urban areas - that have been economically stagnant and under-served, where businesses are allowed to defer a portion of taxes directly tied to profits/income generated by serving those zones and/or developing in them.

I'm kind of pissed at the media for doing such a garbage partisan job by never reporting on this particular incentive.

I am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.

Edit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.

Edit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.

I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.

The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness.

I don’t really do politics.  My general view is that all politicians...all of them, are garbage.  They exist to make sure money flows...and the money flow doesn’t involve you or I...it’s about corporations.  Black lives matter?  No lives matter...they’ll tell you whatever you want to hear to get elected to make money flow into their own pockets and their friends pockets.

With that said and with regards to Trump...
I used to coach youth football and I always believed they’re was something to learn from other coaches.  Sometimes the lesson is what NOT to do.

Also...something a little humorous when you actually press pause and bother to think about it.  Out of all of the presidents, how many can you (yes the OP and anyone who bothers to read my bullshit thoughts..) how many can you name?

Ok suppose you were in one of those classrooms that had you memorize all the presidents...how many can you name that had some major historical significance??  Not many.

For as much as we may think that history is being made...it’s not.  Who was President during the last pandemic?  Who was President when MLK was killed?  Who was the president during the Rodney King trial?

It’s been an unremarkable 8 years.";0;1;0;2020-09-11 03:05:55;1

I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.

The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness.

Imagine if he went to Vietnam, if he was a POW, and if he grew up to realize that everything in his upbringing by his father, Fred, was pure trash. If he had that sense, if he was at least somewhat capable of being empathetic instead of sociopathic, we would have a far different man today. 

I believe the same would’ve applied to Adolf Hitler, if his father was a halfway decent human being and raised him with nurture instead of nature, Adolf would’ve grown up to be a different man. 

As Sigmund Freud said, “there’s no greater importance than the need of a father figure in a child’s life.” The world of woe we share is derived from our own negligence and abuse of others. Enough is enough. Stop preaching hate and stop trying to sow divisions where none should exist. We are all capable of feeling, bleeding, dying. Death does not discriminate, nor should life. 

That would be my message for this world. Never abuse anyone because there’s no worse wrath than the Karma you will endure.";0;1;0;2020-09-11 03:46:21;1

There is no objective truth in what is right and what is wrong. There is only opinion.

An example: how do we fix the climate? Drive electric cars? That will cost a lot of gasoline jobs, people will have less money and with less money they will buy cheaper and more ""dirty"" stuff that will in return cause more CO2 emissions than had you just kept making gasoline cars until they get replaced by electric organically. Organically means when they come down in price so that it's a no brainer to buy one.

I don't know that but I believe this is how it's going to go. I'm therefore against enforcing electrification.

This is the essence of what republicans do, they do nothing. They just let the market fix the problems. People have issues? The solution will become more valuable and companies will provide it because they can get filthy rich doing it. This is what a free country is about in my opinion. Free from government dictation.

Now of course the US is not perfect, but it's the closest to it with republican leadership. No intervention is better than ""good"" intervention.";0;1;0;2020-09-11 04:02:07;1

He has twisted and exploited the Presidency in every way possible.
So many Presidents in the past relied on tradition and a fundamental understanding that you cannot be a despicable human being and be good leader.

I honestly believe for the next 20 to 30 years various law makers and students of history will work to fix these exploits, to close these gaps Trump has exposed.

As a result America will be a much better country, being decent and diplomatic were traditions we took for granted.

Trump ripped up the TPP.

Everyone seems to have forgotten this. I didn't vote for Trump. I dont much care for him, but he earned my respect when he did that.

Everyone has a short memory of the TPP. It was an awful agreement that would have screwed over not just Americans, BUT THE WHOLE GODDAMN INTERNET.

Trying to push the TPP as law is one of the reasons I never cared for Barak. Trump throw that thing in the trash, thus keeping the internet relatively free.

Now it could be argued that installing Ajit Pai into a position of power countered all the good he did for the internet. But you asked if he did ANYTHING at all that was good, and trashing the TPP was good.

These zones were established by the department of treasury and the IRS through Trump tax plan also know as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These opportunity zones are census areas that have historically struggled and have lower economic indicators. Essentially the federal government is giving investors and business tax incentives to establish new businesses in these zones. I think this is a great approach to stir growth in areas that struggle economically because through my experience in real estate and development, growth follows growth. If we could continue this policy moving forward i think the effects would be clear in another 10-20 years.;1;1;0;2020-09-11 05:09:34;1

For those who don't know what that was, it was pretty much the worst mistake Obama made during his presidency. The department of education sent out a letter ""suggesting"" that colleges become arbiters of sexual misconduct, and that they conduct hearings using a preponderance standard (the lowest standard of evidence), and that accused students were not entitled to due process (like hearing the charges and evidence against them or having a counselor available). 

It wasn't a suggestion because the administration strongly implied that they would cut the federal funding to any school that didn't do it. So of course all colleges and universities across the country complied.";0;1;0;2020-09-11 05:17:38;1

Still have a lot to read and respond to!";0;36290;2;0;AlexiosI;"I make a point of thinking about this regularly because I don't want to get caught up in the hyper-partisanship that, in my view, is destroying American society.  It's very difficult to give the President any credit though because, at this point, he is the leading cause of the hyper-partisanship.  Not just a symptom.  The symptoms were like the fireworks going off on the pier of the port of Beirut.  Trump is the Ammonium Nitrate tonnage they lit up.  But give him credit I will for the following:

1.  America was flying blind in the ChiMerica partnership with China.  Anyone who has watched a Chinese action movie like ""Once Upon a Time in China"" with Jet Li should know what China actually thinks of the West.  It is not positive.  It is grievance, scorn and contempt for the ""100 Years of Humiliation"" in their history where foreign powers, including the US, used their military and diplomatic influence to carve off pieces of China for their own economic goals.  An enormous cause of national shame in Chinese history.  The Chinese Communist Party may have opened up to free market reforms, but is has no intention of becoming a Western style Democracy.  Human rights are more or less considered a pain in the ass to the CCP, when they're considered at all.  Intellectual property theft isn't just a problem in Chinese companies, it's their lifeblood.  It is how business is done.  None of this was going to end well.  But American administration after administration kept ignoring the issues while our manufacturing base dried up and the Rust Belt rotted.  Trump was enough of an asshole to finally put a stop to this.  This was an enormous policy change and he deserves a great deal of credit for doing so.  
2. Killing Qasem Soleimani was a low cost, high impact foreign policy and national security move that probably averted a war in one fell stroke.  After attacking our troops in Iraq, the Iranian regime went all in on hubris and told the US ""There is nothing you can do"" about it.  Turns out pride comes before the fall.  We paid little to no price for the killing and showed the Iranians and others in the region we were still a force to be reckoned with, despite drawing down our military presence.
3. Trump is Anti-War.  It may seem counterintuitive but he genuinely seems to have a major aversion to starting military actions.  Just the other day he said the most honest thing about the American military industrial complex I've ever heard in my lifetime, calling out the Pentagon for endless wars to make money for military contractors.  

There are a few more positives, but I think those are the major ones.  My biggest problem with President Trump, even bigger than his personality and massive insecurities, is that he doesn't like to do the policy work that's necessary to run a country.  Any country.  But especially a huge country like the United States.  Everything this man does is quick solutions, photo ops, lip service and praise seeking.  When he gets bogged down in the details he can't hack it.  That is a huge problem for America and it has played itself out on a grand scale during Covid-19 where he has yet to formulate a national plan.  I just don't think he's capable of thinking in a Macro sense like that.  His M.O. seems to be focused on instant gratification within the news cycle instead of long term goals.  That simply does not work for running any sort of large organization.";0;1;0;2020-09-10 23:55:27;1

Trump being president has totally made people funnier. 

Maybe its more of a if-you-don't-laugh-you'll-cry scenario, but I genuinely think the average level of humour has gone up on social media - I can't remember if people are funnier in person or not, but I feel that's more dependent on your friend group anyway. 

Even serious political things have gotten funnier - the whole fake reservations for the rally thing? So much funnier than a protest or whatever people did in the bygone era of Obama and Bush. 

I think there's a ludicrousness to his entire presidency that hasn't really existed before. He's so, so outrageous and available that it's maybe a little easier to laugh at it. Even when people are genuinely concerned, it seems like more people are defaulting to humour rather than anger. 

Obviously that's all anecdotal and maybe I'm just more aware of social media nowadays, but I genuinely think there's been a lot more laughter considering how bad things have been. 

Our tolerance for shenanigans has risen dramstically, too. President insinuated he has the power to delay an election and remain in power? President dangerously  suggested we might cure a virus by disinfecting ourselves from the inside? Meh, sounds like a Tuesday. Obama wore a tan suit and bowed one time and people lost their everloving minds.

1) The first president to actively try to decriminalize homosexuality in countries where homosexuality is punishable by, at minimum, prison. 

2) Deescalated tensions between Communist North Korea and Capitalist South Korea. First and only President to set foot on North Korean soil. The action would have been interpreted as an act of war and Trump also exposed himself to an assassination on the spot. There was no saving him once he crossed that line. 

3) Trump was very influential in the UAE-Israel deal. If you not aware, peaceful relations by the Jews in Israel and the surrounding Arab states was deemed near impossible prior to Trump. 

&#x200B;

**Domestic**

1) Lowest ever recorded unemployment rate for all minority groups across all ages and both genders. 

2) Anti-socialism and anti-communism, economic and political theories that have left other nations in ruins. 

3) Reductions of taxes and regulations on business leading to increased production and employment.";0;1;0;2020-09-10 23:20:09;1

Trump was initially portrayed to us a thoughtless buffoon who was going to kickstart WWIII because of a Twitter slap fight.

Look around you and really ask yourself: do you feel like we're any closer to WWIII? The answer should be no. Let's go down the list.

Trump has not gotten into a missile exchange with North Korea. Just the opposite, he has facilitated diplomatic talks between the leaders of the peninsula. Moon Jae-in even recommended Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize back in 2018. Even if that's merely an offhand comment, it's quite a compliment. Now, a lasting peace cannot be orchestrated by the US alone (certainly not by one POTUS), but it is a step in the right direction. While it's true that diplomatic talks have deteriorated, that is primarily due to Kim's stubbornness (and probably internal hostility from Juche hardliners) more than anything else. We can revisit this issue in a decade, but for now we seem to be moving away from a war on the peninsula.

We have generally disengaged from the Middle East. After expending tons of blood and treasure on costly, endless wars, we are finally starting to bring the troops home. Under Trump, we have avoided starting new, prolonged conflicts (i.e. Syria). This is something I would assume that the Anti-war types would appreciate more, but I've not heard much from them. On that note, a peace deal was struck between Israel and the UAE not long ago. While the UAE isn't the biggest dog in the neighborhood, it's still a good move that will likely draw other countries to the peace table.

Contrary to the notion that Trump is a lapdog for Putin (seriously, look at the sanctions placed on Russia since he took office), we have moved more troops to Eastern Europe, which ought to dissuade further funny business from Moscow. Trump does not want a war with Russia, but he also does not mindlessly hate NATO.

https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/07/29/thousands-of-troops-are-coming-home-from-germany-but-some-of-them-could-be-going-right-back/

One might be tempted to say that we are headed for war with China, which unfortunately may be true, but you have to step back and look at who the aggressor is. China has gotten into skirmishes with Indian troops. They've conducted drills for invading Taiwan. Perhaps most perplexingly, there's even been grumbling in China over their historic claim to the Russian port city of Vladivostok. This is all in addition to their history of aggression in the South China Sea, and their crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. (I recommend checking out China Uncensored for further info.)

The bottom line here is that if things between China and the US go sideways, it won't be because Trump got into a Twitter slap fight and decided to hit the nuke button because his feelings got hurt, or anything like that.";0;1;0;2020-09-11 03:09:11;1

He took an admirable stand against the FISA Court, which I believe is perhaps the most unconstitutional government institution in existence.

You can't simultaneously blame him both for Coronavirus and the current economic crisis, as the economic crisis is the result of the lockdowns which are the only solution for coronavirus. 

 He did make serious efforts, twarted by congress to bring back troops from Iraq and Afganistan, and he did defeat ISIS, quickly and effectively. There used to be constant terrorism in the US and Western Europe from 2015 to 2017, especially in France. All of that stoped once ISIS was defeated. 

 America became the biggest oil producer in the world, gaining it's energy independence from the Middle East. 

 Most other stuff is partisan and cultural, so it's stuff he delivered to his base, not something you can classify as objectively good. He massively slowed down the cultural and demographic change of the country. He reinvigorated American cultural nationalism, across class lines, made the white working class (many ex-Obama voters) into American identitarianism,  reduced immigration massively, both legal and illegal, he put a travel ban on majority muslim countries, he banned Chinese infiltrators, and even at the wall, the places where he replaced the old fencing with new one are much improved.

In recent news we saw Trump saying ""I downplayed it, and I always wanted to downplay it. I didn't want to create a panic."" We scavenged every toilet paper roll in sight and that was the CALM version. Imagine if he had said ""yup, it's bad. We're all gonna die."" Shit would have gone nuts. He closed off travel to China and other countries early on, with much backlash and claims of being racist against Chinese people by the Democrats, and he did his job and left the rest up to the state and local governments.

Trump has been incredibly aggressive on [human trafficking,](https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/anti-human-trafficking-groups-boycotting-ivanka-trumps-white/story%3fid=68615924)in fact its the main reason for the ""build the wall"" it wasn't about keeping Mexicans fleeing out. The border is a huge issue for human trafficking and drug trades. Some kids have been kidnapped at the border taken across and raped as many as 30 times in a single day. Attempting to stop this is alone one of Trump's greatest achievements. That doesn't even begin to talk about Trump capturing Ghilaine Maxwell as an informant to get an inside on the Epstein human trafficking. This is more of a guess and I don't have a source but is it a coincidence that Maxwell was arrested and protected and just a month or so later we found trucks with 30+ kidnapped children in them?

Still have a lot to read and respond to!";0;36290;2;0;Linux-Is-Best;"1, he kept everyone fearful. -- How the fuck is that good?

Answer:

You are not being pacified. America was becoming shitty for some time, but it was always just enough for people to stick their heads in the sand and ignore all the small things that kept adding up.  Occasionally, something big would pop up, and folks would be pissy about it, but nothing would change after voicing themselves, and everyone would put their heads back into the sand.

And this is how America has been functioning well before I was even born. It only got worse and worse. Sure, occasionally, we were given a ""cookie"" to appease everyone and keep everyone pacified. But that ""cookie"" served as a distraction, while many more things were happening. Moreso, there was nearly always the constant threat of having that ""cookie"" taken away, and that too was a distraction. 

Today, moderates (centralist) want me and every progressive to vote to go back to that nonsense. But honestly, as scary as Donald Trump is, I fear going back to the so-called ""normal"" because the truth is the everyday ""normal"" was not working in the first place.  The rich were getting richer, the poor were getting poorer, and everyone was just keeping their heads down. That was scary and maddening.  Why would I want to go back to that?

Today, Trump, the monster that he is, cannot be ignored. More than that, the establishment that empowers him and how things have been working (all this time) have never been more apparent. As a result, every day, ordinary citizens, my fellow Americans, have been engaged and unable to sleep through all of this. They have been participating, became active in current affairs, and are not putting their heads back in the sand.

Do you say the progressive movement will die if Trump is elected? I say, our numbers and our ideals have never been more mainstream and more brought to light since Donald Trump, a fascist conservative, has put the fear of God into more than 1/2 of you. It was the middle of the road, boiling frog, head in the sand, a mindset that had ever caused more harm than Trump ever did. Why would I want to go back to that nonsense?

No, we do not want to go back because going there was the problem, and it took a madman for my fellow Americans to wake up. I don't want you to go back to sleep. There is still way more work to be done.";0;0;0;2020-09-10 23:36:44;0

Economy:

Economic growth has averaged 2.6% under this administration, accounting for why the unemployment rate recently hit its lowest mark in 50 years. Trump administration policies, first and foremost being his signature tax cuts, helped our economy add more than seven million jobs — over half a million in manufacturing alone. (Notably, these were jobs that his economically inept predecessor, Barack Obama, insisted ""are just not going to come back."")

As a barometer for consumer and business confidence, stock-market records also provide greater net worth to that broad swath of Americans who are equity holders either directly or indirectly. At the close of 2019, the S&P 500 was up 29%, the NASDAQ Composite was up 35%, and even the heavily loaded Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22%. And prospects look good going forward.

Wages for American workers are rising, and the fastest rise is for low-income workers. In addition, poverty rates for African-Americans and Hispanic Americans have reached all-time lows. As The Wall Street Journal notes, ""Wages for rank-and-file workers are rising at the quickest pace in more than a decade, even faster than for bosses. ... Average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers in the private sector were up 3.7% in November from a year earlier.""

After seeing their hourly earnings stumble along at 2.5% in Barack Obama's best years, life is once again looking up for middle-income earners!

Consumer spending has surged, a reflection of consumer confidence that is itself a reflection of Trump administration policies. The cancerous 2008 recession, which was seeded by Democrat policies, is now clearly in recession!

Trade:

For the first time in decades, our nation's workers have a president who is implementing trade deals to protect their jobs. And the House just approved President Trump's United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement trade pact, estimated to provide significant benefits to workers, farmers, and manufacturers. Trump's hardline trade stance with China has been politically risky among certain key constituencies, but a balancing of that trade relationship was long overdue and much needed to protect American jobs, our economy in the long term, and our national security. Trump had the brash and brawn to take China on!

According to The Hill, ""As a new year dawns in America, many of the nation's manufacturing sectors are experiencing aggressive growth. ... The steel industry in particular offers ample evidence, with America's steel companies investing some $13 billion in new steelmaking and mills across the nation. This isn't what many economists predicted, however. And frustrated by the flow of such positive news, the economics profession is looking for other means to wage their war against tariffs.""

The Regulatory State:

Trump has rolled back an impressive 8.5 government regulations for every new one implemented, saving American taxpayers more than $50 billion and spurring additional economic growth. According to The Washington Times, ""The Federal Register for Dec. 31 has published 2,964 final rules in its pages, the lowest number since records began in 1975."" Trump thus broke his previous record low of 3,281 in 2017.

The Trump administration has also cut almost 100 oppressive environmental regulations. And our air isn't any less breathable, nor our water any less drinkable.

The Courts:

The Senate confirmed 187 Trump-nominated judges, meaning that 20% of the federal bench is now occupied by Trump nominees. This includes two outstanding Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. If Trump is reelected, his conservative revitalization of the federal courts will continue, including possibly two more SCOTUS appointees. (With gratitude to former Democrat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who nuked the Senate's filibuster rule for judges in 2013 and thereby paved the way for Republican appointees ever since.)

Healthcare:

The Trump administration continues to implement policies that advance patient rights and slow healthcare cost increases, as they roll back Obama's so-called ""Affordable"" Care Act and its disastrous impact on medical care and costs. Successes include the largest year-over-year decline in drug prices ever recorded.

Energy:

The administration's energy policies have made the United States a net exporter of all oil products, including both refined petroleum and crude oil, for the first time in decades. This has resulted in reduced dependence on Middle Eastern oil and a weakening of Russia's export revenue.

Domestic Security:

Our nation is safer with Trump having reached new agreements with Mexico and Central American countries to help stem the flood of illegal immigrants across our southern border. Border apprehensions have since fallen by more than 70%, and the administration has replaced ""catch and release"" with ""catch and return,"" sending phony asylum seekers back to Mexico.

National Security:

America has enormous national-security challenges, but Trump, unlike his predecessor, is not appeasing tyrants. The administration has authorized our military to squash the Islamic State in the Middle East, unlike the prior administration's policies, which allowed jihadi terror to flourish. Additionally, by the end of 2020 our NATO allies will have increased defense spending by $130 billion — a good start. We also withdrew from the UN Arms Trade Treaty and the terrible ""nuke deal"" with Iran. Clearly, Trump has imposed a ""new deal"" on Middle East terrorists, including those from the most significant state sponsor of terrorism, Iran.

And finally, perhaps the worst news of all for Democrats: Despite their impeachment charade — or because of it — Trump's popularity is growing, and he is now the choice among voters against all 2020 Democrat contenders.

It is my hope that in January 2021, President Trump will again affirm his oath ""to support and defend"" according to Article II, Section 1, Clause 8, of the Constitution of the United States: ""I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""

Unlike congressional Democrats, Donald Trump has abided by his oath to the great benefit of Liberty and the American people he serves.

Anything surrounding Donald Trump is shrouded in divisive language and biased opinions. Liberals will have you believe he has done nothing, while conservatives will tout his unlimited success. I must be missing it, because any time I try to research into a topic I get lost in opinion and bias. 

I am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.

Edit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.

Edit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.

Edit3: definitely had my view changed. I wanted examples of positives and I received examples with sources.

It’s a cliche now but there were positives about Hitler’s administration, life for the non-Jewish German got better. Stalin’s Russia has 100% employment and didn’t suffer from economic crashes. There are almost ALWAYS going to be positives in anyone’s administration, but not every achievement weighs the same. He might have done a decent prison reform bill but under his administration America has had one of the worst COVID-19 responses in the world. It’s nice that labor has more rights in Mexico, but he tried to ban Muslims and literally said in an interview that he’d be open to a Muslim registry. He’s used racist, sexiest and fascistic rhetoric. He made no real economic improvements and simply road the economic progress made by the Obama administration. Trump’s administration has been suing to remove preexisting condition coverage from the affordable care act. He banned Trans people from the military and asked the Supreme Court if he could make firing people for being gay legal. Trump left the Paris climate accord and has made a conscious effort to fight against the science of climate change. He used police to break up peaceful protests in Lafayette square and ordered unmarked DHS officers to kidnap random protestors. 

The guy is a fascist.

I am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.

Edit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.

Edit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.

Every president signs thousands of bills into law, so pointing out inconsequential bills (that really don’t matter in the context of leading the most powerful nation on earth) and saying “he did it” is not really that interesting. The question to me is really a 3-part test:

1. Was it something Trump was instrumental in achieving? (Or would it probably have happened either way?)
   Good example: space force. probably wouldn’t happen without him. 
   Bad example: employment- it was basically on the same trajectory as it was under Obama, until the pandemic. 
2. Is it material? (in the context of the overall federal budget, structure or organization of the government, or society writ large?)
   Good example: tax reform, a multi-trillion dollar decision.
   Bad example: increasing school choice by $42 million- that’s literally a rounding error for the department of education budget.
3. Was it positive? (probably depends on your view of the world).

So.... here’s a list that I think potentially pass all three, as someone who finds him pretty loathsome.

1. engaging america in a frank and direct way via twitter, and throwing old dogmas aside. His motives are always suspect but he has rightly shifted our strategic focus to countering china, an incredibly repressive authoritarian state, and he helped changed the public’s view on them and made businesses question doing business there. i don’t love his methods but i think it’s right to point out that they’ve stolen our IP and are posing a challenge to the western order.
2. Tax “reform” WAS good for corporate earnings which boosted share prices a bit. It also actually wasn’t really as good for rich people as the democrats say (i say this as a rich person- deductions are smaller and less prevalent).
3. killing suleimani - let’s be real, obama foreign policy wasn’t particularly assertive and they were scared of their shadows. Most foreign policy experts on both sides would agree obama was not a huge foreign policy success. Of course Iran responded in a highly measured way- the US has escalation dominance vs Iran- they aren’t suicidal. A more aggressive US posture is likely good for world order.";0;0;0;2020-09-11 03:08:25;0

In 2018 President Moon of South Korea also said he should win the noble peace prize. 

He has publicly attacked a military complex, live on T.V.

Trump has put major pressure on China, which is probably the largerst contribution to the things we hate the most. They kill people that do not agree with them. If you disagree with something china is doing it. 

I think Trump is very stubborn but he also doesn't let main stream media dictate his actions. Which is good. He does lack empathy, especially for my people that are of latin decent. I would ask that you understand where you news come from and if reverse the roles how would it be looked at by media. What it comes down to, other than a global pandemic (caused by china) what has really changed in your life. You read how horrible X is but is it really.

So I will point out the one thing that you can’t deny about Trump. His presidency has sparked a change in America. Whether this is positive or not is yet to be seen, but the optimist in me believes his presidency is, at worst, a necessary evil that made the people fight for their country back. 

Things were not good before Trump. Our freedoms are being eroded at an unprecedented pace. There’s global sex trafficking. A whole shit load of criminal activity in Washington I don’t fully understand. The one thing I know about congress is most politicians don’t give a single shit about you, and only care about maintaining their power. Having such a blatantly corrupt president is forcing the people of America to seriously look at their government for the first time in my life at least. And while Trump is getting grilled by the media and the people, other corruption is getting exposed. We can now see how McConnell and republicans disregard their duty to the people to maintain their power. Same with Nancy and the Dems. 

I guess this isn’t a factual sentiment to change your view. This is just my hope for America, that no matter what happens once trump is out of office, that we the people don’t take our foot off the gas, and continue to have zero tolerance for corruption in Washington.";1;-1;0;2020-09-10 23:03:15;-1

I generally approve presidents who can keep the US going without screwing me over.

Honestly, I view Trump's presidency as the only decent one in my adult life. My taxes went down and I saw the most advancement in my field since graduating in the early 2010's. Most industries were doing well until the pandemic hit, but this is a global issue and not something Trump did so I can't fault him for that. Long story short, I pay less in taxes and have no personal complaints during his 3.5 years of service.

Obama screwed up my entire health insurance situation. I had a good plan, it got switched with the ACA and it cost me significantly more to have the same plan for me and my family. Obamacare was a good idea, but terrible in practice. His plan was rushed and not thought out so it screwed over a lot of people who already had health insurance. 

Bush gets the blame for being there during the housing market crash and recession. This put a huge dent in my college fund (there wasn't much left to use when I had to pay for school), and the job market was awful when I graduated college. I also fault Bush for jumping into a War when there was no war to be fought. We wasted a lot of tax dollars on something that did nothing for most Americans.";0;-1;0;2020-09-10 23:07:20;-1

Anything surrounding Donald Trump is shrouded in divisive language and biased opinions. Liberals will have you believe he has done nothing, while conservatives will tout his unlimited success. I must be missing it, because any time I try to research into a topic I get lost in opinion and bias. 

I am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.

Edit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.

Edit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.

Edit3: definitely had my view changed. I wanted examples of positives and I received examples with sources. I appreciate everyone’s responses, and feel better about having informed conversation about DJT’s presidency. Still have a lot to read and respond to!";0;36290;2;0;NA;[removed];2;-18;0;2020-09-10 16:59:23;-18
